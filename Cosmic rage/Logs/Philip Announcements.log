[announcement] from Your boy Dante: Hi folks, while working to make the shopping network for televisions, I discovered that many of you have stuff for sale at 0.0 credits. Let me just say, I didn't do it and I would advise all shop owners to look into this and fix your prices. Thanks!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hello everyone! I have just received a mail that states the lag should now be over. Enjoy!
[announcement] from Faylen: Some of you have mentioned that they think the requirements for higher ranked factories are a bit over the top. A few of us have been discussing this with players and each other, and we have made a couple changes. The most significant is that we have way scaled back the custom exits requirements. In addition, a couple of the lower ranked factories got a small boost to max rooms. As soon as you type build, your factory will be updated if it is a large factory or star base Enjoy!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! So I originally was not going to announce this, but there's quite a bit too it so I'm going to have to. SDF outpost theta15 is now open and under a new name, it is in the same sector, but now orbits a star which is called Aurum Victoria or golden victory. The layout of the planet has completely changed and there are a lot lot lot lot more features: 1. Ground missions now have descriptions which show in the view command. 2. Air missions now show in top players and brag. 3. You can now defend the planet in a new combat activity type thing, see aHelp airpod defense, there is now new armour available, and... Well, there's more to come down the line. My confidence is quite low with this one, so let me know what you think. Enjoy!
