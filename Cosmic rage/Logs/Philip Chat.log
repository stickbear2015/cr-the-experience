[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: is there any MI member that's available to answer a question for me... due to the nature of this question, it might be best to meet face to face or via a link.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hello all.
[Chat] MI Private Vazbol meows a greeting
[Chat] A human named Mileta transmits a loud roar
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Vazbol... you might be a good source to ask this question of. May I obtain a link, please?
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale transmits a deep floor trembling rubmle
[Chat] MI Private Vazbol in a soft mew: Don't make me meow at you directly Mileta.
[Chat] MI Private Vazbol in a soft mew: And sure.
[Chat] Austin Blake: The only time that humans should roar is when they're er um...

[Chat] Zaien Dragon fire orange designation in a chitter: would anyone know if the preium miner is capable of hauling asteroids?
[Chat] Alex Blood red designation in a chitter: i don't think so.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: any ship can be equipped to haul an asteroid, provided it is able to land on said asteroid.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: where's the best place to dump debris, etc? for cash and points?

[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: sounds like it's time to break out the hammer.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: trying to make a joke.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: It says sir if you're a male and... miss if you're female I believe... haven't used a pollution cleaner in a long while.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: but, what if you're an it? Haha!
[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: random question, but who in the world feels the need to take a dump on a landing pad?
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: It'll kick you out of the vehicle.
[Chat] SDL Lieutenant Kavi Lavender designation in a  firm but quiet chitter: I know right?
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: wo that's nasty.

[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: go for it.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: WHat do you call a droid that looks like and is the size of a planetoid?
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: no clue, what do you call a droid that looks like the size of a planetoid?
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Droid?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: a planedroid.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: aha.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: aww.

[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: pixelated.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: hmm, if i new what it was.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: it's the first I've heard about i.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: it.
[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: it is supposedly some new game or entertainment thing that is beeing released.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: aha.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: should be interesting.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Ooh, something interesting at least? Unlike the... other games...
[Chat] Trista Vinova: Bread and circuses.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: hahaha.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: the other games, well, hmm.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Can math really be considered a game?...
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: not one bit.
[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: of course, lots of games require math. Plenty of card and stratigy games require math.
[Chat] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: if you break a video game up in to it's basic components you can even loosely relate some of those to math.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I meant doing math...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: right then, time to rank up some more.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: three months for just taking a dump? That seems very excessive.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: if that had happened under my watch, you bet your ass I would get that time brought down to less than 30 days. Absolutely appalling.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: yeah 3 months does seem like a really long sentence.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: in fact, that offence is just a fine, and the person in question forced to clean it up. Absolutely ridiculous. the courts have put folks with a much serious offence in for less. This is why if not checked, the courts can get corrupt.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: indeed.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I am going to see to this person.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: you would do a better job than I would. I never got into law.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: holy shmoke.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: and that just for a dump. heh.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: who did that by the way?
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: heck if i know.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I'm not sure.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: but some dragons dump their shit just where ever they like, so what are we even bitching about.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I am in communication with the man now, and filing a motiion to have that sentence brought way down.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: a motion.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm clear of sector 6, I'm now studying in 1.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I love wormholes.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: oy i hope ye don't get problems with it bud.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: with worm wholes or star studying? I'm confused.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: with studdying in 1.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Probably the star studying. At the point where I have wormholes, I pretty much don't worry about stars anymore, it's second hand.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I should be ok. I didn't think about any other sector, unless 3's got stars.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Plus, stars behind wormholes are better than the ones in locals, and you don't need to announce them.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: true that!
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: indeed.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: then I might find roids and planetoids and nebula fields. so I can find liquid nitrogin.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: You make liquid nitrogen...
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Woah, I need to refill the star probes! I'm down to just under 600!
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: when i get into rank 40, do i have to do some sort of pilot exam or can i just buy one right away?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: like do i have to pass something in order to be considdered a pilot?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: from what the piloting manual says you don't have to take an exam until you get to the higher rank ships at 200.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I think.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: 100, but yes.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oh.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I thought it was 200 for some reason.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: leneya anderson?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: paging leneya anderson.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: yes?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: would you like to buy 100000 more pannels for the same price?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I feel terriible but I don't have enough.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: terriible. I only have one catrillion left.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: well, maybe when you get the money again.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: sure thing.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: enough to lay down some foundation.

[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: it's been a while but I think you go south? Check your map.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: You want to go generally south until you get to the crater. You'll do a bit of up and down, but mostly south.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: okay. here's hoping I'll do okay.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: good luck.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I'd reccomend setting GPS Beacons at the rocky plain and base of the mountain for emergencies.

[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: but maybe I can dock with you?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: I just don't want to lose my research items if I can prevent it.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: actually, I just thought of a solution.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup.

[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: er follow.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: No, not usually.
[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: ar ok thanks.
[Chat] Saiteja Muppavarapu: It's not only the 1-pilot salvagers that don't have lasers, even the premium salvagers don't, which makes things a bit complicated.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: right?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: how so?
[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: think so.
[Chat] Saiteja Muppavarapu: I checked the weapons status report in my premium salvager, and, from what I see, the ship appears to have no weapons, not even lasers.
[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: yeps.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: it's a salvager why do oyu need lasers? you can't mission with it.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: that's a major oversight def-d sweep.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: fail.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: anyway. that's a major oversight.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: how so if you have ratika anti nesters you don't need lasers on a salvager.
[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: that is make credits starship not combat starship.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: exactly.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and if you don't have the defences you need? what then?

[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: yes?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: all you need to do is ask for help yes? and someone will help you. do you need ratika anti nesters?

[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: yes.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: hmm.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: need to see how much they are and what rank they're at.
[Chat] Saiteja Muppavarapu: what are they?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: if you go to a vermin store and hit the outfit button it'll out fit your ship with things that'll help and you can buy the anti rat nesters and deploy them before you salvage. to help shoot down pods.
[Chat] Wigther Brotsom: are there planetoid exploring get more points than salvaging?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitterTransmits through the sound of loud, earsplitting speaker feedback: NOT SURE AS I'VE NE ER DONE IT.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I need to expand my drone bay farther to add more drones, you can never have enough anti-rat nesters!

[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I was going to sign up to be a JAG but I didn't for the singular purpose of avoiding all the paperwork.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: every one exaggerates the paperwork, it is only a small hill, not a mountain.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Have fun with the bugs. They've made some improvements.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I wonder what happened to my paperwork, speaking of which...
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: Paperwork? Booooring.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: that, dealan, is none of my authority as I am not handling your case.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I am aware, Miss Lovelace.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I despised paperwork. I know that some will have to be done when or if I get into the sdl, but yeah.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders transmits a long pause.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I never do sdl paperwork. That's why I have sabordinates.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: glad of it, dealan.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: that is a lot of credits for item, on tv....
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: more than Jerore has..
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: what is it?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: yes, but if I get in, I'll be doing paperwork since I'll be a low-ranking person at that time.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: moon scanner device...
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore only has trillion level of credits..

[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: I try not to be.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore try to be Jerore.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton well, I know it takes *exactly* 1 hit from either the beam cannons, torp salvo or molecular disrupters on my fighters to kill a vacus fighter. so...
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: Meh. Shooting enemies sounds like far too much work. I would code a program that would interact with the ship's systems, target and shoot them without me having to d a thing. Same result with much less work, don't you think?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: part of why I do missions is because i actually get to be the guy who signs the death warrants of these vacus bastards.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: since I'm the one pushing the buttons.
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: but what about being the guy who pushes one button to kill 280 vacus ships. Much less work, and you still sign their warents. Just ... all at once, if you know what I mean.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: well yeah, but even so. coding that kind of program would put a lot of us pilots out of business if it ever leaked out. think about that. and when I say a lot of us pilos, I mean a lot of us pilots who take pleasure in spacial combat.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders transmits a long pause.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: oh these vacus.. they are so cute.
[Chat] Josephina Coral pink scale in a soft musical thrum: how far away from a comet do I have to be to extract?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: yahoooo! I now have a moon base! That wasn't so hard.

[Chat] A cute little tabby named Lilymay in a soft mew: i think from reading the manuals the hardest part is maintaining it?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: probably... It's gonna be my first one, so I don't have high hopes for it, if we are beeing honest. but it will be interesting to see exactly how it blows up, yeah?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: lady Julia hi!
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: hiiii!
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: lady Julia well?

[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: awe, Jerore would have gone with if he knew..
[Chat] Arienne Orchid Pink designation in a chitter: I would worry if it were fast.
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: is the moon heavy?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I have another 13 minutes of hauling to go, think I'll have a coffee.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: could you do me a favor, Miss julia, and have some bacon and eggs with that coffee?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: well my ship sure thinks so. it will only go at warp 5.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oh damn.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: can lady  Julia not go faster?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: nah, if I go faster the teather would break, and then this moon would go on a rather accelerated course in to a beacon station. What with the laws of motion beeing what they are it might even hit the poor beacon station, and I'm living on the poverty line so I don't have the money to buy a new beacon station.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: oh....
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: yeah let's not do that.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: No, you have money.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I do not.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore sorry lady julia, he trying only to help lady Julia.
[Chat] Arienne Orchid Pink designation agitated:  That would be deadly for the station's inhabitants.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: what's going on.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton transmits in a calm, quiet voice:  please do not destroy the beacon station. doing so could be hazardous to your face. thank you.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: my face? well... that was one I wasn't expecting..
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What going on? Tobias worry for brother Jerore and Julia.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders transmits a long pause.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: define the poverty line... II've wondered if I'm above it or below it.
[Chat] Arienne Orchid Pink designation in a chitter: Your very existance.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I have 0 credits.
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: and plus I don't think the beacon station would not like it.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore fine brother Tobias brother Jerore at home.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: julia, you want to fly the moon into a beacon station... like a canon ball?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I'm pretty sure the beacon station would be very angry at julia if she destroyed it.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: wrecking ball, actually.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I'm pretty sure that if the beacon station was destroyed it would not be capable of feeling anger. in fact, it might surprise you to know that beacon stations can't get angry even before they blow up!
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: or so we think.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: that's what I was about to say.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: have you asked one lately?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I'm pretty sure that when ships blow up, they're pretty bloody pissed off.
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: tabloids would have a field day with this conversation.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: I am more amused over the amounts of pilots actually believing julia, a high ranking SDL officer, would do it. Gullible.
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: I have seen some weird stuff in our little patch of the universe.
[Chat] Martin Garrott131818 in a drone: SDL Midshipman threatens to blow up a beacon station with a moon.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jeroreknow better!
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oh, I know for a fact she wouldn't do it. I'm just over here having a laugh.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: shhhhh, Madam Lovelace. I am not a high ranking SDL officer... I found these rank sleeves in a box of cerial.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: cerial was aweful, but the insignia are pretty shiny.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace transmits a long pause.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace transmits uncontrollable laughter
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: just how bad was the cerial?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I tossed it in the bin.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: it make vacus tasty?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: hey, I had a vacus burger earlier. not at all bad.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: make vacus toejelly tasty....
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: only 4 minutes to go. then I'll be able to start this moon base and see what all the excitement is about.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore see when done?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Oh nice I was thinking about building one my self.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: sure!

[Chat] Jerore Sonders cheerrs
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: sorry MR. Waters. I convinced madam lovelace to let me have it for a project I was doing that involved the testing of the safety of an office chair.

[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I say shrink that may by a mile and we are closer to the truth.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: what was that?
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: figaro was hungry, and I wanted him to eat that stupidly large squirrel that's been following me around.

[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: eco, sorry.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: it's disgusting.

[Chat] Katia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: Katia will talk to you.
[Chat] Katia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: Katia is lonely too.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Elenhiia, I can be your friend if you'd like.
[Chat] Raven Shier in a faint british accent: hello.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I like friends.
[Chat] Elenhiia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: Would be very nice. Like making things, but like people even more.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hi hi.
[Chat] Raven Shier in a faint british accent: I like people as well.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I'm approachable, I don't bite, well, not unless there's food involved.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders transmits a long pause.
[Chat] Elenhiia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: Am not audible, so it is OK.
[Chat] Elenhiia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: edible, I mean.
[Chat] David Brooks: I think we all like people.
[Chat] David Brooks: So, who all has moon bases?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: not Jerore he is not strong enough pilot for such a thing yet.
[Chat] David Brooks: hate trains when I have an aircraft.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore like his aircraft.. is bus.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I want of this planet, the weather needs to let me off!
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: weather will clear,time it will take.
[Chat] David Brooks: Of course, I can not fly these aircraft in doors.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders giggles:  no is for outside.
[Chat] David Brooks: So of course, i took the aircraft to the train station, and then I took the train.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: it save time.
[Chat] David Brooks: A bit, sort of.
[Chat] David Brooks: Just got to sit here until I am back at my aircraft now.
[Chat] David Brooks: I had to buy new star probes. Stars keep on eating them.
[Chat] David Brooks: Oh boy!! sw.
[Chat] David Brooks: Oh boy!! What a take off.
[Chat] David Brooks: Love it when I can fly from point A to point B though.
[Chat] Ahldomyre Out of Ilyin in a grinding rumble: hello!
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Greetings.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: hi.
[Chat] Olivia Bronze scale in a sing song rumble:  shedding, shedding, olivia is shedding, shedding shedding olivia has shed.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: That sound painful.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Shedding actually is very relieving.
[Chat] Olivia Bronze scale in a gentle rumble: it is quite refreshing, brings a fresh flow of oxygen to your scales.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: not really, something we dragons are used to.
[Chat] Erik White scale sighs
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: much better, but only 2 this time.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Nine for me.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: 23 here.
[Chat] Olivia Bronze scale in a gentle rumble: fifteen for me.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: nice.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What dragons count?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: the amount of scales we shed.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: scales.
[Chat] Rheeni Purple scale in a growl: I suppose it is just as a little competition.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: sure.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders giggles
[Chat] Erik White scale laughs
[Chat] Svetlana Sonders: Greetings all. How's things?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Hey hey. Good, nah-mean.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias good. How human female?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Doing quite well.
[Chat] Svetlana Sonders: I'm good.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: greetings, Svetlana. I'm well, and you?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hey Svetlana. Good, how are you?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I'm doing good. thank you.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton over the quiet hum of ship engines:  It is way too damn quiet.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Quiet it is.
[Chat] Svetlana Sonders: Yes. I noticed that myself.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale through the loud sounds of drones hammering:  not here on Zintech.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Here on the moon is good.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: indeed not. I'm trying to find someone that I need to repay because of a little. erm. Accident I made earlier. no luck so far.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: auth.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oops.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: stupid communicator.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: You're drunk.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a slightly cold voice:  I'm not, actually.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: He sounds bored to me.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: exhasperated would be a better term. but there is a bit of bordum in there as well.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: hmm. to have coffee, or not to have coffee. Choices choices...
[Chat] Philip Williamson: coffee!
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: to have coffee. Always have coffee, man.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: coffie is good.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Why are coffee pots only sold on one planet in the entire alliance. This is a crying shame.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: You could make coffee with the liquid in your tears...
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: If there is one thing I miss about home, it's how easy it was to just go down the shop and buy myself a fresh cup of coffee.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: naa. it's too salty.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale laughs
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: and who wants saulty coffee?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I have never had coffee, so I would not know if that is a bad idea.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I heard of some military officers doing that on earth way back in the 20th century. ttalk about odd.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: think they called it something like...navy brew?
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Hello.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello sister Alexa.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello brother!
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: hello.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I cloned on a beacon station. is there a way to travel to tilariia from one?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Which one? I'll pick you up.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Hinyana.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: And no, there isn't a way that I know of. Taxis don't go to beacons.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Bay clear?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: yes.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Damnit, Itold you to clear the bloody bay!
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: you alright there, Friend ada?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What happen if not clear bay?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: you will die.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Yeah, but I went to pick Leneya up from a beacon station, specifically asked if the bay was clear, and she still got sucked out.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Ahh. I see.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Maybe Leneya not understand Ada?
[Chat] Alexia Warrin: what's wrong?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: What the heck? No planetoids in the planetoid field?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: oh look! The planet I need doesn't have bad weather anymore!
[Chat] David Brooks: So, how is everyone?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Just fine, you?
[Chat] Raven Shier in a faint british accent: very good. and you?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: well, I'm breathing, so I'm good.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Oh no.
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: doing well thanks. and you?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias good.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I just ... landed in a volcano ... and did not blow up.
[Chat] Izik Sondro: Peachy.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am doing ok. Thanks for asking.
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: that's a good thing, right?
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes it is.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: That I did not blow up? Yes! I am relieved.
[Chat] Izik Sondro: How did you manage that?
[Chat] David Brooks: Debris prices dropped even lower I see.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: yep might as well just keep your debrs.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: debris.
[Chat] David Brooks: Agreed.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: use it or your own factory.
[Chat] David Brooks: Guess I can work on stars or something for the same price as it were.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: probably a little more actually.
[Chat] David Brooks: Looking at the debris prices, I can go unload a full load for eighty tril or so.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: chunp change.
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble:   i honestly think that people have less money now because there is no debris market.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: hmm. to mission or not to mission. really wish I had a ship with a good enough obf field to do bombing runs.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: no ship is good enough unless yur military, you just have to take some hitts.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and you know that...how? you could have obf level 5 and you'd probably be good.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: You take a lot fewer hits with obfuscation 5.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Right, but the mother shipps can see through them, or so the info of that mission says.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: They can.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: For a bombing run it's just the two motherships to worry about, and even then, two shots with a solar cannon sort them.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Turtle drones are useful.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: if you ahve a solar cannon.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Especially if you have a level 2 cannon.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: even a fully upgraded civilian ship can kick a whole lot of ass and look damn good doin' it.
[Chat] David Brooks: Agreed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I plan to eventually install a solar cannon on my battle charger if i can.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Right, for sure, I'm just saying your not gonna avoid all the hitts on that mission.
[Chat] David Brooks: I got a few ships I would like to install alot of solar cannons on alot of ships per say.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: But 2 mother shipps isn't too bad, it's better then 10.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: which is the mission I chose one time.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I never said I wanted to avoid hits. I know i'd get hit. that's why I'd have others with me. No way in hell would I do a bombing run solo.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I do bombing runs solo all the time.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: you're a lot more experienced than I am, ada.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Not that much more.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Not by enough to make a difference in a bombing run anyway.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I'm rank 346. I don't consider that a lot of experience. there are still a lot of upgrades I can't get yet.
[Chat] David Brooks: Forgotten how little you could get at that rank.
[Chat] Denny Chandler laughs:  bullshit... you know you're a lot better than that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: okay, I can gun well enough, I'll say that.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Basically, once you get to the rank where you can do bombing runs, there's not much more to learn.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: aha.
[Chat] Denny Chandler chuckling:  that was directed at Ada over there.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I dunno, those specialist missions look tough.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oh. my bad.
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble:   yeah. i would say you would need to learn about those.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: i had fun when I did a waypoint mission with julia. we got up to like 6 I think it was.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and then james and I did an outpost this morning after I killed about 100 greenbirds.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I've still got 54 ranks to go unti lI can get obfiscation field level 3. then another 50 so i can get a battlesuit, which I do intend to do.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: What is obfiscation?
[Chat] David Brooks: It is what hides your ship a bit.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: basically, it hides your ship from other ships' sensors.
[Chat] David Brooks: It is vary usefull.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: that it is.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: so is the holovid.
[Chat] David Brooks: Agreed.
[Chat] David Brooks chuckling:  Have you tried landing with one of those things turned on? You get to see people run from it.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: yeah I have actually.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have seen drones fly out with me before when launching from a beacon station.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: hello Alexa.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: how is Jerore doing?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore is well.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: has taken up to drawing things with pigments.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: that is good.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is fun.
[Chat] David Brooks: So, sense debris prices are down a bit, what have people been dong for more cash then what is on offer for debris?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: nothing really, been struggling, that's what I've been doing.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I don't even have enough to afford the cheapest of things at my rank.
[Chat] David Brooks: What rank are you at? Just wondering.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: What is the best way to get a car from new Notches over to the landing pad?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Take it to the runway, relocate it to another planet, and relocate it back.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Ahh. I did not realize the runway was set up for that. Thank you.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: what kinda car did you get, dealan?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I will show it off momentarily. Let me see if I can get it into my ship first.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: When I got here, the weather was too bad to land.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: ah shit. I hate when that happens.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: one of those classic cars?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: indeed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I love my little Ferrari 458 Italia.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I got one. It's a Prius. One of the most eco-friendly cars of old earth. It's a shame they weren't made earlier than they were.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have a classic sitting here in my ship.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I wonder if there's any sport cars.
[Chat] David Brooks: I got a jag here.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: that's what my ferrari is.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I managed to dig up a retired Crown Vic Intercepter.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oooo, nice one david. do you know if it's a type c or what?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: A Jag? Like an atterny or something?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: this is a classic dragon car that is prized for its looks, or so my research tells me. I certainly feel fancy driving it.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: no no.
[Chat] David Brooks: Do not know the moddle. Just picked out one that looked nice.
[Chat] Ada Hopper cackles:  No, a Jaguar. Notorious for high prices, and frequent and expensive maintanence.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Ahh. I was about to say.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: cause I got a JAG. And she's the barrister. Haha.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale chuckles
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: another old earth car I've heard of is a bugati.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Ahh good, I can land now.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Weather over this spot on Mars.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale grumbles
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: you know it's a shame we don't have a sort of track like area so we could race each other on one of the planets.
[Chat] David Brooks: Have you notice that any classic that you buy now days have been some what upgraded to today's standers?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Anyone seen a Toyota or Honda for sale? Those I've heard had some nice classic vehicles.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have not.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Nah. We can race on harmonia or something.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: or earth. From the landing pad to the garage and back.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What going on?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Well I imagine you would not want your car to just break down. Self-repair systems are something I would hate to do without.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I love the old Crown Vic. It's not an especially good car, but it's absolutely shocking what those old cops would leave on when they retired them. Get a retired CVPI and you can scare the piss out of someone easy.
[Chat] David Brooks: Never knew that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oh man I've heard harmonia is a bitch to get around.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and I've never seen a crown vic.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: It can be. Most of the time I just fly there, but it does sound like a great place to practice my driving skills.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I need to drive there more often for sure.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: just make sure you add one of the landing pads to the gps, so you don't get lost if you need to get back in a hurry.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: of course I'm a pretty slow driver. I haven't gone above 40 yet.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Indeed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and I did that first thing.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I have... if you've heard the engine in those, you'll grin. It's a big vehicle, but that engine has no trouble getting it up to speed.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am a really bad driver, but I am pretty good at getting around in my ship. Go figure.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: right?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I haven't manged to. er. what's the word? total, my car yet.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: that would totally suck.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have not done that either.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: right?
[Chat] Denny Chandler laughs:  nothing like the sound of a deep-throated V8 to send your pulse racing... enough said there I think.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: that's what my ferrari has I think. v8.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am going to have to drive people around in my car to show them the fun.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: that is totally not eco friendly, man.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: another car I want to eventuall yget is an auti R8.
[Chat] David Brooks: I think they replace the fuel tank with a battery now days. Do not quote me if I am wrong.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: my girl's got one of those. well, an audy at least. Don't know what model it is, but still. She likes luxury cars.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: yeah, they'd have to.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I don't remember what the hell mine used to have, but it's now full electric with speakers to simulate engine noise. Real bitch to setup, but it sounds great.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: nice. smooth ride?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it may not be eco-friendly but you get more respect with a V8 engine then a piddly electric vehicle.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I don't need respect in a car when I can fly a starship, dude. Nothing can get you more respect than saying you can go anywhere any time.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Yes there is. Build your own starship.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I am actually going to do that. Drawing up the plans and everyhing. Now I just need to get some minerals and stuff.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Lot of work. Maybe I will go star coring or something. That'd do it. I think I have all the upgrades, because with the state of the economy, I won't be able to afford anything.
[Chat] David Brooks: There is nothing that is not even better than taking your own custem built ship into a fight and coming out the other side in one peace.
[Chat] David Brooks: I need to find away to make more cash out of star coring. Every time I loose focus, I take a bit of a beating at that.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Just don't lose focus. Sadly, that's the best option.
[Chat] David Brooks: Plus, I am a bit slow at the controls at times.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Oh that gps beacon system... That is very very convenient.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: It is nice.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Right. Where shall we meet so I can show off this new car?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: what's going on on beacon station gamma?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Was there something going on?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I disembarked and the evacuation alarm was going off.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Oh dear.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: It's not blown up.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: yep, the same thing was going on when I visited beacon station beta earlier.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: alright. Well, seeing as it's not safe to land on beacon station gamma, maybe I will give beacon station delta a try.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: anyone on the landing bay, get out of there, cause I am coming in.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: How many uses do these hole repair kits have before I need to replace them? Does anyone know?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Just take a look at the kit, it'll look more empty. I think it's three hundred uses.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: hmm, I know it's a lot.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: of course, I haven't used one in a while, thank the stars for hole repair modules for ships.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: OH yeah. I can get with you on that one.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: man. I need to buy a tracker.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I doubt I have the qualifications to use a module, much less the cash for one.
[Chat] Denny Chandler sounds of footsteps on a ship's deck:  I still can't believe how big this pinnacle is...
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: yeah. Charlie has one of those. I don't really go for the huge ships, really.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: and she has a starliner. another giant ship.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: well, for me, this was meant to replace 3 other smaller ships.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I want a pinnacle eventually. haven't seen a star liner yet.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: neither have I. Wonder what rank you need to buy one.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: It's all huge rooms and vaulted ceilings. Nice and luxurious. But it's not my style of starship.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: let me see.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: oooo. I'd love that. of course I'd also be that weird bastard who'd put weapons on it too.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: looks like it's the same as the legionaire. 850.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: oh... hmm, I should be able to get it then, as the pinnacle is rank 900.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Could somebody do me a favor and fly me over to Beacon Station Gamma?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: well, now I have three ships to look forward to geting. no actually, four. a reaper as well.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: sure.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: where ya at?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I'm at Earth.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: on my way.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: be there in a sec.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: it's a race!
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: you there already, Denny?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: ok, here... board throught the weaponry airlock.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: alright.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: What is a good installation type for defense drones?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: the first option.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: five hundred defense and what ... twenty horse power or something?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale sounding annoyed:  It looks like my ship did it for me. I wonder what it chose on my behalf.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Laser, I mean.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Dammit, Mars.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: if you need to leave the planet, I can come get you.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I do not believe Mars has a teleportation station.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: How is that? My ship will not launch.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: teleport down.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Yours would not be able to either. I was going to attempt to clean orbit someplace.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Hmm.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Correct, but I can use my ship systems to teleport down and bring you back up with me.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: or up as the case may be.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: earth is a good place for that.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Could you please get me to Research, so I can study a few things?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Of course.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I am at the Starbase.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: One moment.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: Greetings.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: friendly greetings to all.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: hmm...
[Chat] David Brooks: Uggg, wish I could pull this faster than warp 5.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: WIth your art kit?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: misscom.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ok, hauling that moon did not bring me much.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: That is frustrating.
[Chat] David Brooks: took closed to twenty mins to haul it in too.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: big boom!
[Chat] David Brooks: they paid me 239 bil or so for hauling that one moon in.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Well hauling moons is only profitable if you don't drain the moon of it's minerals.
[Chat] David Brooks: I did not drain it of anything.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Which of course means you do not get them.
[Chat] David Brooks: Next time, I think I will just take the resources for myself and give them out as I see fit.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hello all.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: greetings.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: so, I'm curious... is a starliner a clan-specific ship and if not, where can I buy one?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: It is not. Go explore Central Carstairs.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: There are some truly wonderful ship options there.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I need o do that myself.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: They just added holographic directories to guide you around the place. I saw them yesterday and they are stunning.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: hmm, ok... to be truthful, I've never been there.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I have visited there, but only to grab a few modules.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Please, I encourage you to take some time and walk around the station. Running through, following your mapper's directions and not paying attention to the beauty around you, is wasteful and disrespectful to Olivia, Gladr, and the hundreds of engineers and crew that put their hard work into building it into the place it is today. At least, that is my opinion.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: noted, sir.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Of course we all must hurry along our way to get things done, but topping to appreciate what is around you can be just as entertaining.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton transmits in a voice of deadly calm:  indeed...
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: and yes, you have ever yright to rebuke one such as mself, for clearly I have shown gladr and olivia no respect by not taking time out of my day to appreciate what they do.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: erm, every, myself. I apparently don't know how to talk.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Meh. I'm sure it's alright, my man. I just chill and go with the flow, nah-mean? And I for sure don't know how to talk.
[Chat] Quentin Waters laughs cheerily
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: no, you really don't.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: I wish i had a musical instrument to play, need something to do.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I don't think so. I owe gladr and olivia and every single engineer an apology, I think.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale sighs in a grumble:  I see you misunderstood me, even with this translator.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: i don't think I misunderstood you, sir. I felt I was being rebuked for not taking time out of my day to appreciate what gladr and olivia do. which truthfully, I haven't. so...
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: I feel it is important for us pilots, who get caught up in everyday activities, to not take advantage of the support staff that allow us to do such things, I suppose. One of the ways I try to remember them is by enjoying what they've built. Not just for function, but also form. Does that make sense.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: wow, this mall is nice...
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: it does. and in that regard I understand where you're coming from, 100%.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: It makes perfect sense to me, sir.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: hmm if i b8y this ship i will only have a bil left.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: my problem is that I cannot stand being idle. I feel like I have to keep working just to make things work. so my free time is rather limited.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Good. And in this regard, Olivia and Gladr and their staff are support staff, building and maintaining a station that provides us with quality technology and goods, but also a space to relax and explore and behold the wonders they, as artists, have created for us all.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: I still feel like I owe them one hell of a massive apology.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale over the sounds of a couple of button presses:  It does not seem that they are on comms at the moment.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton: apologizing over comms doesn't count in my book. neither does an email. I would prefer to give them this apology in person.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello Alexa.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: how brother Tobias?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Alexa!
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl my stars... this starliner is so *a long pause* gorgeous...
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello Jerore, Denny.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Hi, Alexa, how are you?
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: I am well. and how is Denny?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I am well...
[Chat] Philip Williamson: cam someone send me some metal panels? I'm in a planetoid field and ren out of panels to repair my bays.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I wish we could. But you will have to go get those on a landing pad even if I did send them.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: you can't use the delivery drones for those?
[Chat] Syuri Dark green scale in a growl: do you haave a battlesuit?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: no I don't. sadly, I'll retreat to my factory and grab some.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: In order for someone to send you metal panels, or more accurately for you to get them, you would have to land and collect them. I could come deliver some to you however.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I bailed from the field, I was nearly done with it anyhow. I appreciate the thoughts, though.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Of course.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: You reminded me I have damaged cargo bays of my own.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: does anyone remember where the dragon named Sarah Silver Scale hangs out on science core? I forget.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I believe the Research dome Beta?...
[Chat] Philip Williamson: Their doesn't seem to be such a dome on HQ, and i"ve been all over it, I'll check the labs.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: a silly question, but I'm presuming I need to make the quantum refinery from a blue print on my factory?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: Hello.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hey, how goes?
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: Pretty good. yourself?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Oh, can't complain to much, just doing some star work.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: that's always profitable. either way you can use the energy to kill stuff or you can sell it.
[Chat] Austin Blake: In this instance, it's all towards ranks and credits for my next big project.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: oh?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Soon, I shal be venturing forth in to the realm of moon collonization.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: very nice.
[Chat] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: I've got a long way to go for that.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I can't lie, the risk and rewards have me very excited.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Sup, everyone. Just remindingyou that I am throwing a little celebration concert at 20:00 GMT on Valiciana later on.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: If I am a little late, it's because I was held up somewhere else, but I shouldn't be late. Hopefully.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: what time will the concert be, sir?
[Chat] Elenhiia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: Music?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: oh, you're actually going to play like you promised... Well damn, guess that means I have to dress up nice and tuff.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: wear your best stuff today,
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: sorry. I was searching for my notes. Yeah, it's going to be at 20:00 or around there. GMT, mind you.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: and Julia, if I say I am going to perform somewhere, you best believe it. I don't d it as often as I did back at home, but I still like giving a little concert from time to time.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Wow, guess he told you.
[Chat] Ahldomyre Out of Ilyin in a grinding rumble: there a lot of different times!
[Chat] Quentin Waters laughs.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: i can't get to goscro crah i keep jumping to it and it keeps moving.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: when you can get it, get the chasing upgrade. it makes your life that much esier.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: agreed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I have it on my ships and love the hell out of it.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: yeah can't get that one yet.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: comes standard on both the starliner and the pinnacle.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: same with the battle charger.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I think.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: all those ships do not help me as i'm only rank 57.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: keep busting your ass and ou'll get to buy those ships eventually.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: you'll, too.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: ahh, a still fresh from the academy, wet behind the ears pilot.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: my ears are not wet?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: it's an expression.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: sometimes I forget that Larkens are hydrophobes.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Actually, I think that was merely aa translation issue.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: It's a saying that people say.
[Chat] Elenhiia Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: If Elenhiia were made of electronics, would never go outside! Would hate water too. Snap crackle pop!
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez giggles
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: and boom.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: and thud.
[Chat] Denny Chandler sounds of beeps, whirs and clicks:  Sorry, I'm so used to using obscure human expressions as slang.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: well this ship only goes 30 how could are race build such crap?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: it's a starter ship.
[Chat] Tyler Chambliss: is it true that when you use combat drones they also blow up the cargo containers from the enemy ships?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: starter ships generally suck.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: rules and regulations limit what types of starship tech, not to mention other tech a newer pilot has access to.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I'm not sure about that Tyler.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed. for good reason, too.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: plus there is the sheer joy of learning new technologies as you're able to obtain them. I still remember my reaction to the remote interface for starships when I first got access to it. Now it's a part of my everyday piloting toolset.
[Chat] Denny Chandler coughs:  er, sheer joy.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: never have used the rermote interface yet.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: erm, remoe. excuse me.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton coughs and transmits:  rermote? yeah that thing.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: right. remote. there! I actually said it correctly!
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: manual piloting haven't done that since the academy.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: oh. can't afford that one hmm.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Hey guys. So I am going to be a little late, but it's okay. We'll start on Valiciana  at around 12:30.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: but it's still happening.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale snorts
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Could a dragon or ryuchi please help me with an armor frame?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: you can find smithis on Navu and Goscro.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Yes, and some people are better trained then the smiths.
[Chat] Tyler Chambliss: who owns friendship owasis, or however you spell it?
[Chat] Tyler Chambliss: Who owns Friendship Owasis? ooc what?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: how much energy does 1 solar cannon shot take?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: 400.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Okay.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I personally think you really only need one installation of that weapon. but that's ust me.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Well, I probably wont give it to all my weapon rooms, but I think a few will have it, I have enough cargo that I could probably let a few people fire them at once.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: bullshit... if you've got the cargo bays, plenty of water and the needed upgrades for the solar cannon, the more the merrier.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: maybe. but do you honestly trust people with that much power?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Well, my secure deck gunner I definitely will trust.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: second that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: hmm...
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I will rust people only if they show me they can be trusted.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: trust, too.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: A for my public weapon rooms I'll probably just give 1 weapons deck hte solar cannons, to save me a lot of time, and save my cargo.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: the solar cannons, ahem.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: apparently my comm hates me today.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I wouldn't give just any pilot with the rank access to my solar cannons... I need proof that you can handle the responibilities that come along with pointing the business end at something.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: agreed, denny.
[Chat] David Brooks: Well, as long as I am surround by the vacus and there is noone else around to help out, then I may just give every aboard access to a solar cannon if, and only if they can be trusted.
[Chat] Alexa Out of Ilyina in a grinding rumble: hello.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: but how do you know they would be able to be trusted if they hadn't sown you beforehand?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: and hi there.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: that's true.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello Alexa.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's why I'd only have one on my ship if I got one. and it would be in the control room.
[Chat] David Brooks: Have you heard of only letting people of whom you trust aboard?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I'm pretty sure I have, sir.
[Chat] Austin Blake: No your ship, and know your people, assign them according to their strengths and your trust level.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: that isn't necessarily true, just secure your control room and you can let anyone aboard. And put someone you trust in engineering.
[Chat] David Brooks: Just saying that if you have solar cannons in every weapons room, you might want to know who you are bring aboard.
[Chat] Austin Blake: And give prraise to the all mighty blast door, may it's metal reign supreme.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Oh i I wanted to put solar cannons in every room, it would be torture on me.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: obviously.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: for me it goes this way... I don't let anyone on the bridge of my ships unless I've worked with them, know how they think and react to a certain degree and most importantly are able to follow instructions. Also, if you can legitimately hold your own in a debate over tactics, then that ups your score in my book.
[Chat] David Brooks: THat goes without saying.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: indeed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed. when it comes to tactics I'm pure shit.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Tactics isn't necessarily as important in the bigger equation as is finding someone who can learn and adapt to new situations, and who has a core of loyalty.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Then, they'll adjust their tactics to the situation, and will also work to safeguard you in a shitty situation.
[Chat] David Brooks: fair points.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: to some extent I disagree. I would rather everyone on my ship have at least a basic knowledge of tactics.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: in various areas.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: then you're excluding new pilots who are too green to understand tactics as of yet.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I agree, so let us say that it is better to have someone who is well rounded out in most situations.
[Chat] David Brooks: I require people in my weapon rooms to know what and how each weapon are use or at least the basics there forth.
[Chat] Austin Blake: New people with a desire to learn are by their own definition, trainable, and willing.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: gair point.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: no.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: horrible, I prefer my sacs to be huge.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: er fair. will I ever. learn. to talk. correctly?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: yeah, but what would you rather have? A pilot who follows instructions blindly without question or one who will step in and question your command decision when they know that lives depend on that decisiom being in error?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: true.
[Chat] David Brooks: With me, the more you know, or at least the more I know you know helps me out a bit when surrounded.
[Chat] Sydney Silver designation in a chitter: hello all.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello ryuchi.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I'd rather have someone who has the balls to question what I do when lives are at stake.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: but only when the need calls for such actions.
[Chat] Austin Blake: It's always a fine balance between the right to question, and the ecknowledgment that there can only be one ship commander.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ok ok ok, I have to agreed when it comes to when lives matter.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: In my opinion, when we're talking about the alliances in combat, every life matters. doesn't matter who it is.
[Chat] David Brooks: Of course every life matter.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: agreed... You'd earn my respect far more if you can show me the error in my ways rather then letting a potentially dangerous situation cost lives.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: wow this cannon is amazing.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have not used the solar cannon yet.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: definitely agreed, denny.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: it's quite powerful.
[Chat] David Brooks: Is it more powerfull than the railgun?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I've seen them on a couple ships, but haven't used them. and i won't unless im given permission to do so. otherwise, nope. same with pulse cannons.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: hope you have water to cool that bad boy down... it will raise your heat signature.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I seen that.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: thankfully I do.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: the railguns is an AOE weapon of sorts, a solar cannon is not, so it is not a fair comparison.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I've used the railgun once. that was fun.
[Chat] David Brooks: The pulse cannon going off at the wrong time is something bad.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's what I've heard.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Well, that and the railgun in my oppinion it's too risky to use it, unless yu know your enemy can't hit you, I definitely would advise the railgun.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: wouldn't.
[Chat] David Brooks: About like sayin, here I am. come shoot me.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: exactly.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: for laymen and laywomen, the railgun is a weapon meant for a wide dispersal of it's payload while the solar cannon is a more directed weapon.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yep. lightning lasers are also AOE.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Maybe if they could come up with something that would let you keep your defenses up while firing the railgun, then maybe it won't be so useless.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: plus you have to lower your shields to use the railgun.
[Chat] David Brooks: You sort have to drop your defences for the railgun. Is the same for the solar canon?
[Chat] Austin Blake: No.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Don't know about shields, but I didn't have to drop my defenses.
[Chat] Austin Blake: But, you need to be prepared to cool yourself down quickly.
[Chat] David Brooks: Thanks for the info.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I doubt they'll come up with something that would allow the railgun to be used with defences up. tHat heat signure would still show up on scanners.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: erm, signature as well. but yeah.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: oh, your heat sinature is like a beacon saying here I am.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yep.
[Chat] David Brooks: Oh the heat from the powerfull weapons.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: the weapons wouuld have to be constantly cooled internally or something. And that would take a lot of water. or they could use air cooling, but again I doubt that would happen.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Now, that ship name, puts me in the mind of one of those old swiss army knives.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and someone correct me if I'm wrong, but even with an obfiscation field up, your heat signature can give your position away I think.
[Chat] David Brooks: Agreed.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Well, the heat signature, i understand, but their should be a way to fire the weapon with your defenses up.
[Chat] Austin Blake: yes, it can,.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: it can, yes.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: as you have no heat signature til the weapon is actually fired, then your defenses would at least let you get in to position to fire.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I've found a star that pulls at a rate of 16 units per second.
[Chat] David Brooks: Outch.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: that's... almost unescapable.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Gah! Now I have to go try to track down another.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: nakon, even if there was, it wouldn't make any difference. you'd be found faster than you could hide.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: The point isn't t hide after firing, the point is the hide until you fire.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: and getting to position takes time. and in battle time can not be wasted.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Going to need to be ultra focussed for a bit, so comms off, this has been enjoyable, gents.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: my thought is that as a pilot, especially when fighting, your goal shouldn't be just to destroy the eemy. it should be to get in, hit hard, and get out fast.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I say unescapable as I'm not sure if the specialized training you can obtain could get you out of a star pulling at 16 units.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: er enemy.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: and denny, I was actually able to obtain that training recently. haven't been able to make use of it yet, but...
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Sure, but if I can take out every last ship, I'm gonna do it.
[Chat] David Brooks: If you use the right drive in time, you could get away from a star.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yeah, but wouldn't you want to do it as quickly as you could with minimal casualties?
[Chat] David Brooks: You would.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: my guess is a quantum drrive...
[Chat] David Brooks: It should if you get it on in time.
[Chat] Denny Chandler coughs:  er, quantum drive.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed. I learned this from julia. who by the way, if she has comms on, I'd like to publicly thank for the training she gave me before I applied to be in the sdl.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Aha, found one at only 8 units.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yeah that's much better.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I haven't even used the quantum drive on my pinnacle. Don't think the starliner is equipped with it.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: there was a star through a wormhole that I once got. It pulled at a massive 24 units.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I can't get it yet.
[Chat] David Brooks: I had to buy it for my starliner.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: holy shit.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: How good is it?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: 24 units?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: second the holy shit.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's just a big fat ouch waiting to happen.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: indeed, needless to say, I got out of there fast.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: that's scarty.
[Chat] David Brooks: Triple the shit.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: scarry.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I think if that happened to me and I didn't have the needed training, I'd be fucked for sure.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: that's like instant death.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: brandon, you still on Valiciana?
[Chat] David Brooks: Is anyone going after that ship smuggleing.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I've balanced with it.
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a strong chitter: yep.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: julia has got it I think.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Now comes the dull part.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: wait, who's smuggling...
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: ongratts.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Smuggling is a losing game anyway.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I've never done it. and i never will, either.
[Chat] David Brooks: It was anounced on the mapper.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: sounds like it doesn't pay enough.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Smuggling is a losing game anyway.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Not for the risk your taking.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: wait is that a patch you can get?
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: I do not understand why people do it when legit buisness is more profitable simply because there is a lot more of it.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I've never done it, and don't think highly of those who do. There's so many ethical issues with it.
[Chat] David Brooks: I do not understand it myself seeing that cash can be gotten via easyer means?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: oh shit.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Jerore knows not mess with warrior goddess.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Building material transport makes people happy rather then upset.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: oh, him... that asshole managed to get someone's ship blown up during an invasion because his dumb ass didn't follow instructions. I nearly went to blows over that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: wait he did. what?
[Chat] David Brooks: You got to be kidding me.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: this was back in the early days of my career as a pilot... now I remember who's ship blew up. It was Stormy's.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: oh man.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: all I will say is that virtually every pilot worth their license knows when and more importantly when not to use a pulse cannon.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: to get into uncharted space, do I have to go specifically from omega or sector one? or will it work from anywhere?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I have never used one. ever. and unless given the goahead, I will not do so.
[Chat] David Brooks: agreed there.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: pulse cannonsa re one of my favorite weapons.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: ahem, pulse cannons are one of my favorite weapons.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: but again, you have to use disgression when using them, nakon.
[Chat] David Brooks: They make you seen.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: of course, they drop yur obf field.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: they won't be when you suddenly find yourself without an obfiscation field protecting you.
[Chat] David Brooks: Good point.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Just have your crew fire at the same time.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Except for you, of course.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: oh that's good, those animals were cared for, I hope?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: lightning lasers have their own issues... let's just say it's the quickest way to lose deployed turtle drones if someone on your crew lets one rip.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I almost never use those.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I used to use those a lot, not so much anymore.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I like ramming.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: With big ships.
[Chat] Denny Chandler giggles
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Hm?
[Chat] Denny Chandler laughing:  For a second there, I had to wonder when this conversation went into the gutter.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: What is wrong with ramming?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: without the mention of a doing it via ship, like you first did, it means something a bit... risque.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: ramming is not what it use to be, seems the enemy know better tahn to cluster together like they did before.
[Chat] David Brooks: Let's just say that if you go up the wrong end.
[Chat] David Brooks transmits a long pause.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: So, I shouldn't ram?
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Is there any reason to have a small ship rather then a big one?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: small ships are easier to crew I think.
[Chat] David Brooks: And you can get them in to more places or should I say more spaceports.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: other then the issues with cargo bays and pirates?
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: easier to land since they won't take up as much room on landing pads, yes.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I've gotten away from smaller ships lately. Plus in most cases, both due to ease of access and bypassing weather issues, I teleport down to a planet. There are a few circumstances where you have to land, upgrading a ship for example.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Aside from a vehicle bay and drone bay, the usefulness of a ship for me is how many cargo bays it is. Unfortunately, the cargo wheel has no vehicle or drone rooms.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: that is a dated ship.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I love my pinnacle.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: It was well worth the price.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: I have a custom-built freighter that unfortunately is built off of a tiny ship frame due to a lack of ruby. It does however at least match my specifications exactly.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: yes, I like the pinnacle as well, and the starliner is a gorgeous, beautifully crafted bit of luxury. I honored the memory of my mother by naming mine after her.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: niiicie.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I still can't wait to get one.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I never did buy a starliner.
[Chat] David Brooks: To me, the star liner makes a good apartment.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: What's the price?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: 150 trillion.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: Let's be clear, the pinnacle will help you out in combat. The starliner is a lovely ship that has been decorated well and is designed for long distant journey.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Not bad at all.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and you need to be rank 850.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it's got some teeth, but it's like a cruise ship where the pinnacle is geared toward combat.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I'll probably get one of each.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have one of each.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: The pinnacle is the best ship I've ever bought.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: I've seen friend gladr's clan ship on missions, that one is beautiful.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: ah, the cruiser?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I bought the pinnacle to replace two reaper mark 2s and a phoenix if that tells you anything.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: he took me on a couple missions once and I got to crew with him aboard that hip. it's a lovely vessel.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: i think it was a cruiser, yes. has a caduceus on the back for what ever reason.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: ship, too.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yep, that's the one.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: ahhh hmm okay. yes, quite lovely. I would like to get a custom ship for our more... intense meetings for the JAG, I might look into this.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I still like my legionair.
[Chat] David Brooks: That ship is sort of out of date now.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I guess the only quibble I have about the starliner is what it takes to go from the high-priority airlock to the bridge... Every other ship I've owned has had more direct access to the bridge.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: And the fieldmaster.
[Chat] David Brooks: The complaint I have about the star liner is the weapons and armor.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Its not really ment for combat.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is clear when you have a look see.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: the thing about most ships is that it makes no logical sense for your exit and easy forced entry is not smart near your center of operations.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I know that... but it makes a statement when you arrive to pick up someone in it, especally if they aint seen one before.
[Chat] David Brooks: That statement can easly coust you a ship.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: the weapons are standard. it's a luxury ship. I own one, and love it.
[Chat] David Brooks: I like the fact that my airlocks do not go directly to the bridge.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: and if you go through high priority, your living room has a teleport onto the bridge.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: talking about the starliner?
[Chat] David Brooks: Ok, forgot about.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: mhm.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I know, as I said... it's a quibble since I'm used to the more direct access. It will take getting used to.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: that reminds me, I need to get mine furnished.
[Chat] David Brooks: I need to do the same at some point.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: I love that ship. that said, I love my pinickle as well.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I need to furnish mine, and figure the best spots to secure with scanners.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have been flying around in my star liner for months without buying all that much for the inside.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I need a factory decorater.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I need to find a interior decorator to consult with on my factory... someone who might help me realize the vision I have in mind for the factory.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Ouch.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: whopsy! someone just went pop in sector 1.
[Chat] David Brooks: Another ship blew up today.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Someone's ship got crisped.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: damn.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: uh oh, who gave a star a hug.
[Chat] David Brooks: Now me. I am kissing one.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: apparently someone who owned the reaper Mark II goldstar.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I'm harvesting one.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: hey, stars gotta eat too.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's true.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am kissing one as I said. After all, what do you call it when you probe a star?
[Chat] Denny Chandler sounds of a star munching happily on a starship
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Debris canister?
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I might go for star cores soon.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: it is a canister full of 192 thousand units of debris.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: oh.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: damn.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's a lot of debris.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: before I do anything, I need to get my industrial plant set up, but I have no clue what I'm doing.
[Chat] David Brooks: I would like to get a moon set up for my use at some point. Just not at a high enough rank for a moon bace.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Same here.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I do hope the pinnacle has enough charge to allow me to fill all 20 bays with solar energy. I know I had to upgrade the batteries on my reaper mark 2s to pull it off without worry, so I'll assume maybe.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is alot.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: That would take a lot of time.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: just a drop in the bucket.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: yeah, but the payout for 10 cargo bays with the reaper mark 2 was in the multibillions.
[Chat] David Brooks: I do not have the wish to take that long trying myself.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Man, Julia you got debris coming out the wazzoo.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I pay my people good.
[Chat] David Brooks: Filling all 20 bays with debris would bring you alot more cash for the amount of time.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I've done 4 sessions filling all 10 bays on the reaper in one day, but that was so I could skip the reaper mark 3 and go straight to the pinnacle.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Has anyone used mining drones?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: damn you, Quentin.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: strangely colored? I mean, he is tan.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: HYey. I'm nbot strangely colored.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: well, you kind of are.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: No. You are. That's racist.
[Chat] Quentin Waters laughs.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: sorry, sir, I'm only racist on fridays.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders giggles
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: but it is Friday.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Not days that end in the word day, right?
[Chat] David Brooks: There goes another ship.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: What happened.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: getting lost in these caves sucks, I'm looking for the room to purchase an industrial plant. I keep getting lost.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: How much do they cost?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I don't know yet, but when I find where I want to be I'll tell you.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: well lots of liquid on the resource market to keep that plant lasting a very long time.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: Hm, that price.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it took lots exploring for me to gfind it, but I think it's in the canyon somewhere.
[Chat] Veto Red scale in a growl: I might buy some when I get the money.
[Chat] David Brooks: I need to really learn how to make use of these dark mines that I have seen out in deep space.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: they are great.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: about 4.1 million barrels up.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and that's the reason I need an industrial plant up and going. I miss Synergy, my trusty helper drone.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: my ship does not have quantum fuel capabilities. can i still use the quntum drive? how do i make my ship have this ability?
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: there is a shop on star command for that.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Hello.
[Chat] David Brooks: I use warp fuel or unless until i get the correct upgrade built for my ships.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: heyy.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: How are things?
[Chat] David Brooks: THings are going fine as far as I can see.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: what shop is it in?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: actually, that price is not bad considering the time it would take for anyone to gather 4 million barrels of liquid.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: quantum drive I believe. something like that.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: it isn't in there.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: upgrade manager on your info comp is your friend.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: not seeing anything when I search. just quantum drive itself and warp fuel drilling.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I could gather 4 million barrels of liquid in about 20 days, if I felt like it.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: wo...
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is a lot of barrel's.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: I am not finding the fuel upgrade.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I believe you have to make it.
[Chat] David Brooks: You do have to make it, but warp fuel will surv you until you make it.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: oh ok. I need the quantum drive for going into uncharted so i can collect dark matter. i don't have a plant up yet.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Well, have fun quantum drives are expensive to learn how to use, then expensive to buy.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: I've got the cash.
[Chat] David Brooks: The quantum drive will work with warp fuel for now. They are pricy to use.
[Chat] David Brooks: I turned mine up to 42 before and what a kick.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: you might want to check out lavender annex. You can't use that plant for anything, but it's there to jump you way out to the edge of charted space or how ever you like calling it. Anyway, it's a short cut.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: yeah, if you aren't sitting when it kicks in, you will be shortly.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: save you a tun of quantum fuel.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: where is that located? can I find it with the computer?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: you can rift to it.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: it's an industrial plant. usually when I need a plant I use that one to jump me out close to where I want to be, then I go a ways off and set up my own plant to work from. I never keep them for too long, though I should now that debris is so easy for me to get my hands on.
[Chat] David Brooks: Wish I could have someone make me the fuel upgrade for my drive, but it looks like I will have to go out and figure out how. Guess it would be alot cheeper than asking someone else to make it.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: oh speaking of industrial plants, if anyone has 3 solar cannons and the accompanying upgrades for them, I'd pay something like 2 quad a piece.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is alot of cash.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: 6 quad for the lot of them, there abouts.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I'd be willing to get them for you for that much.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: take me a couple days though.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: let me know something. First come and first serve.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: right.
[Chat] David Brooks: If I was having to sit and come up with the cash for that with just hauling debris, I would have to take alot of time.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that's why you go on mineral missions with a few friends, get a shitload of minerals and sell them for that much cash.
[Chat] David Brooks: And I can guess what missions help with that.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: not enough minerals for my liking.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: mineral missions?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: and that's from a moon, brooks, not a mission.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: eheheheh. I've only gone on a couple mineral missions once, and that was with julia. Her and I plus a few others did a couple one night. they were fun.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: interesting.
[Chat] David Brooks: Oh yes, hit the moons for those. That is easy.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: no worries, michael, if you are looking for some minerals, I can surely sete you up.
[Chat] David Brooks: If all I hae to do is to find a bunch of moons for minerals, then that is easy per say. That is if you are willing to follow a few wormholes.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I've grown to really enjoy the heavier missions a lot. I remember when Julia took me and some other folks on a waypoint mission. First time around we got totally boomed, but then the second time we made it through like. what was it? 6 of the? waypoints?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: it's from moon building, not just going through wormholes and extracting minerals.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: yeah 6 or so. It turns out I don't like those missions much.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: awww. how come?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: well, are the soloable?
[Chat] David Brooks: As for moon building, I am currnetly now high enough for that yet.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: erm. I don't think so, nakon.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: not soloable if you don't ahve level six obf.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: too many shipps?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: you'd get popped very, very quickly.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: The gunners get fatigued as well from so many waypoints.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: oddly enough I didn't.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: if you're talking about specialist 1a, it's not a waypoint.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: there are something like 10 mother ships and 40 war cruisers. give or take 20 or 30, then there's all the other smaller ships that actually don't actually matter much because you can mine them to death.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am thinking that I want to build on a moon as soon as I can, but I do not meet all of the requirements yet.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: greetings.
[Chat] David Brooks: Hi there.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: now that was a bidding war.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: there's still a lot that I can't do, but I'm looking forward to the day when I can do stuff like star studying and the like.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: here ya are, Michael. This sac might be more to your liking.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: wow.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: that's a nice sack of minerals their.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Might have to work on getting one of those moon bases your making a killing over their.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: wo, is a lot of minerals!
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: we aim to please. Also that's not from the moon base. that's from reserves.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: wow.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is alot.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is pricy.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: eh, it should be. took me about a month to gather up that sac.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: think if she work on for three month.
[Chat] David Brooks: That is alot of them.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: damn it I want that sac!
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: only because he is a new attorney, I let him have that one.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: does anyone remember how many room extensions an industrial plant can have?
[Chat] David Brooks: I think I know what I am going to find myself doing for the next few days.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: what's that?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble looking minerals for... *giggles*.
[Chat] David Brooks: Filling my cargo bays with stuff to auction.
[Chat] JAG Attorney Jay Smith: thank you, that was quite an interesting auction.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: enjoy those minerals, jaye.
[Chat] David Brooks: It was interesting for sure.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: wow that's a bit high ain't it?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Nah, they are worth it.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: believe me.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: what are they for?
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: how is it possible to make quads on here?most I've ever gotten from a run for something is 5 trillion.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: You turn them in.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: here in the starships.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: i have.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: get you quite a few ranks.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: just 1 of those, I'll auction more if people want them.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: i do get quite a lot for starship wrecks. just trying to figure out how I can make quads as it does help with purchasing upgrades. does dark matter mining give a lot of profit?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: no.
[Chat] David Brooks chuckling:  What does?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: you can join my trivia game. I was going to originally only give 100 trillion credits per correct answer, but today has been good business. perhaps I'll give 500 trillion per correct answer.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: ooh, where do you join?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I don't know yet, I've still got to come up with good questions.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and where do you turn in the cube?
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: it's the datachip research center on tarania.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: never been there.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: why can i not relocate to goscro crah?
[Chat] A human named Renee in a far away tone of voice: it may have moved.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: i mean with my vehicle.
[Chat] A human named Renee in a far away tone of voice: yes it might have moved. you can't always relocate there.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: oh. Okay thanks.
[Chat] A human named Renee in a far away tone of voice: you can't always relocate to other planets as well.
[Chat] A human named Renee in a far away tone of voice: and no problem.
[Chat] David Brooks: Tip for all. harvest yourself as many Minerals as you can. They bring lots of credits at times.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: oh?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: hi all.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: Hello.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: how are you, sir.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: how ya going, erik?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: i'm a going good there!
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: all systems are functioning within normal parameters.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: are you sure?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: well then. a taxi just arrived here, but no-one's here for it.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: Am i sure what?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: it's for you, erik, hop on and see where it takes you, adventure!
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: aha.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: not for me, i'm in me ship.
[Chat] Erik White scale laughs
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: I'm sure. My internal diagnostics are working properly.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: do you need any help here on mars, clayton?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: only i just saw you exit that taxi is all.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: I'm trying to accquire a decent ship for my rank.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: aha.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: well, what rank are you currently?
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: I am rank 60 at present.
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: ah, well, maybe one of those little fighter things?
[Chat] Erik White scale in a growl: ah, volcano harvesters flying around.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: Mayhaps someone might be able to help a Mutariansi out, but, how does one obtain the module to allow the new members of our alliance to reclone on our factorires?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: they are able to be built in a factory, I think.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: does anyone with an industrial plant think they could make me the necessaries for a quantum fuel refinery, etc? I'd do it myself, but I haven't yet figured out where to put my own plant, and with quantum being faster I'd rather use that to get to my industrial plants parking spot.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: are we supposed to have blueprints for these new cloning facilities?
[Chat] JAG Attorney Jay Smith: yes, I found one in a cargo barrel a few minutes ago.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: sup guys.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: bioplasma harvesting is a bitch to your heat shields when the rods cause it to explode. Maybe I should avoid them for now.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: wow that's expensive as shit.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: no kidding.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: how can shit be expensive? isn't it human waste?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: What was expensive?
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: somebody is selling hman waste? I believe I must know where this is, that I may properly avoid the area.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: oh that auction.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: That is repugnant.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: you mean the auction for a hand fool of minerals for five billion?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: damn, she killed my snappy combeack.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: er, comeback.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: yes.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: You could get more minerals from an asteroid.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: I'd say it's a rip off, but I don't try to get in the way of other people's grind.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I probably could pull that much out my ass.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: I'd much rather stay with my cores.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: Sir Denny, how may I ask are you capable of removing minerals from your prosterior?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it's an expression.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale rumbles out a deep chuckle
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: I have always been a failure at expressions.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: That sound scary.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: cute, but not.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Why is my ship not entering the asteroid field? I am at the coordinates inside of the field, but when I try to enter, I get a message that I "hit force field."
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: auction abuse... flooding our coms with useless shit.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: yeah. that's the button you hit to fly into the field.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: you hit forcefield to enter the field. If your autoscan is on, then you will see how many ansteroids, planetoids, or what ever there are.
[Chat] Denny Chandler chuckles:  and then you promptly explode... just kidding. Gotcha.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: As i was talking, my heat shields turn off. and I am star studying right now. Not pleasant.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I receive no information after hitting force field.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: tap the autoscan button and once it's enabled, tap the ss button.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I get: "scan what?"
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: that sack took me a while to make.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale sighs:  I forgot to recall my antirat nesters again.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: I do that all the time.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Ok, so I tried entering field, then "scan asteroid," and got "no asteroids detected." Then tried entering field again and rescanning, same message. But how are there no asteroids in an asteroid field? Makes no sense.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I aint used those in so long...
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: note to self. always recall your drones.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: do you have an asteroids scanner apart from your field scanner.
[Chat] A lion named Orran in a superior roar: was just about to ask that.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: It's an asteroid hauler, so I would assume so.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Check your sensor status. Not every class of ship is reasonably built, in my experience.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Wouldn't an asteroid hauler have what it needs?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Ahh. right. Let me see. What sector are you in and what are your coordinates? I can come take a look with you.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: if you want.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace after a long sigh:  I don't know, ask stargate, if they're the ones who built it.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I was about to offer help, but once again, Quentin beats me to it.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Coords are 605, 345, 350.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Okay then.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: what sector did you start from.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: tyler, stop it with auction, you're doing nothing but giving yourself bad attention, unless it's attention you want.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: wait what is he auctioning?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: 01.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: nothing we want to know about.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: I've turned auction off. I have no time for that kind of thing.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton with a hollow, merthless laugh:  same here.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Ship located in Uncharted Sector 01-90-01-F, 1 universal units from galactic 0.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: what's your coords?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: I found the ship.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: would somone be willing to make me a vehicle charge booster?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: How are you contacting me in that way?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: heh, haiing...
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: the sector comm. Hit the SCOM button on your ship's console and speak into the microphone.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: er, hailinhg.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello Jason.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: you should be safe now.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Thank you.
[Chat] David Brooks: Love these drones.
[Chat] A tiny ball of slime named Alyssa: Where can I buy baby stuff?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: Harmonia.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: daycre on harmonia.
[Chat] JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace in a light British accent: daycare, pardon.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: anyone selling a tug ship they don't want anymore?
[Chat] A tiny ball of slime named Alyssa: Thank you.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello mutariansi.
[Chat] A tiny ball of slime named Alyssa: i.
[Chat] Clayton Quinn152099 in a drone: why am i getting spot checked every single time i launch?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: all pilots check for spots.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: I? Tobias not understand.
