[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], where are my settings stored so I can port them to my other computer?
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], Hi!
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], hi!
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], you did not save the buffers when you first ran the pack then. I was very clear this must be done. Type SaveBuffers now and then load them.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I did, see the last line in my report.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], This should not be the case. You are the only one who has had issues with this.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], I'll look into it tomorrow
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I can attempt to dump the buffer config manually and re-do it. where's it barried? I know i find the strange errors.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], it's in your main VIP directory. Bufferlist.txt
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], hang on
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], once you get rid of it, type SaveBuffers again. That will create a new file
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], would you like a wtf moment?
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], sure
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], bufferlist.txt doesn't exist!
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], oops
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], and savebufferes doesn't create it, let me....
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I wonder if.... back in a minute, restarting in admin mode.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], ok, running vipmud as admin let the damn file create. the fuck.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], broken. Rofl.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I'll take credit for that, if their's a troubleshooting file, this might wanna go in it.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], I can not do this. VIP does not have a if file exist function.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], does it have something for if error? that can be used unside another if then else statement for that section? If I can hunt up the code, I could probably write it.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], no. Not that I know of.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], blame greenwood and his stupid ass
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I tried, lol.
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], Nice job!
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], that shouldn't have happened! I've got an asist in about it.
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], still, nice job
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], apparently I need new batteries!
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], that's because I couldn't spell, so wanted to copy/paste.
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], You'll get lost.
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], If you type links wrist, you can see hwere people are.
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], how'd you die!
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], i'm trying to get time for my clone to stop being stupid
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], Hold on
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], yay for maps!
[You to Emilee Hamilton OOCly], I found my way.
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], Hey blindy... Stop being blind!
[Emilee Hamilton to you OOCly], i need levels and money. lol
[You to Andrea Rimirez OOCly], rude, apparently I have to read the citizinship help file and register before I can raise my level.
[You to lara stardust OOCly], I've been hanging out at the train station on temrith for like 10 minutes without a train showing up, is the loop busted for that task?
[lara stardust to you OOCly], aparrently.
[lara stardust to you OOCly], you should see one coming soon
[You to lara stardust OOCly], might wanna fix that, maybe? lol.
[You to lara stardust OOCly], are you the goddess of donator items? grins. I thought I'd let oyu know if you are that person that a support ticket exists for a fun one.
[You to lara stardust OOCly], nope, still no train.
[lara stardust to you OOCly], give it time :) The scheduler did just scream at me for being fat
[You to lara stardust OOCly], and as I said one shows up, and fat schedulers for the lose!
[You to lara stardust OOCly], and as I said that one shows up, and fat schedulers for the lose!
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], pods are fixed.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], woot! credit to a phil face!
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I wrote that code on my phone! while driving, mudding from the laptop, writing code in the notes app!
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], did you input the changes into the log and the soundpack?
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], no because it was a small change.
[MakaChela Hernandez to you OOCly], i did not receive the trill yet but i'll get started in a little bit. I just woke up for the night. I will try to do 45 rooms but we'll see how far it let's me get.
[You to MakaChela Hernandez OOCly], let me see.
[MakaChela Hernandez to you OOCly], if your note in fact said you needed 45 rooms when you currently have 28, you need to report that it is a bug because the help file says you can only build 50 rooms in a factory and 65 in a large factory.
