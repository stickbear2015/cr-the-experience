[Intel] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: working on it sir.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton: I take it that, as a pilot of relatively low rank with no armor and not a lot of combat experience, I wouldn't be much help?
[Intel] Ryeu Blue designation in a chitter: incoming.
[Intel] MI Private Vazbol in a cackling chirp: Thank you for that.

[Intel] Roxi Blue designation in a chitter: What happened?
[Intel] Jason Hamilton: what in the name of all the races was going on? I deduced that thre was a battle, but I could get no information other than that.
[Intel] SDL corporal Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: yeah, well it is sometimes hard to talk and shoot at the same time... basically a bunch of droids decided to throw a party on our planets, we didn't really agree and so we decided to throw them out. They didn't want to get thrown out so we had to blow them up with grenades, which by the way is kind of fun.
[Intel] Philip Williamson nobody parties on our planets without our permisoin *roar*.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton: ah. well, that makes sense. I apologise.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton: though I do feel really bad that I was not there to assist you.
[Intel] Roxi Blue designation in a chitter: I thought I heard someone say something about a mining base?
[Intel] Tobias Out of Zaharov in a grinding rumble: Let Tobias know if healing needed.
[Intel] MI Lance Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: Any ground volunteers come to tube alpha on star command for grouping and organization.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton: uh. that's gonna be a problem. I am not good at ground combat...
[Intel] Emilee Hamilton: I dunno how.
[Intel] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: responding, I'll be on station at about the same time as the invasion will.
[Intel] Izik Sondro: Can someone inform me what happened earlyer?
[Intel] Zaien Dragon fire orange designation in a chitter: Testing, please excuse me, my wrist communicator took a blow last bout with the Vakus. I think i have repaired it.
