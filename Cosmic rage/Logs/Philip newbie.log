[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: I'm going to assume that's a great way for everyone involved to become off white

[Newbie] A cute little tabby named Lilymay: tasks then view?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: yeah, I hit the option to view and the task is there, but here's the thing, I don't see any results from it yet, and I'm still able to use my citizens to build stuff
[Newbie] A cute little tabby named Lilymay: ah i see...good thing to assist or something. I just went off mhelp tasks. i'm not even near moon base rank.
[Newbie] Arienne Orchid Pink designation: How often do volcanoes go off these days? I'm very sorry if that is inappropriate for newbie.

[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: nope. once they're deleted, they're gone.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, I reported this, but I have never seen this. I was doing pollution collection, and when it said my collection was successful, it did something automatically, and I got a traceback with an ID of 77. However, when I tried attaching it to the report, it said 77 was not a valid ID. Then, I checked my cargo hold, and it said 1/100. Yet scan still showed pollution at the same coordinates, and when I typed collect, it said "the vehicle is already collecting pollution." Not sure why the traceback id is showing as invalid.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Sorry, but your command has produced a traceback and can not be executed at this time. We would appreciate a report with the details of your traceback. Please do not use this command again until further notice. Thank you. This traceback has the ID of 77. You will need this when you report the command.

[Newbie] Veto Red scale: Its not broken
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: is that what it says?
[Newbie] Veto Red scale: It says your landing gear isn't in motion.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: assist then maybe.
[Newbie] Leneya Anderrson: I'm trying to get debris to my factory, but no drones were found. what do I do?

[Newbie] Austin Blake: Okay, I'm confused, I processed the rocks from digging, but, I still have rocks in my cargo bay, what do I need to do?
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: So this may be a silly question but... how do you control a wax drone? None of these commands do anything on their own and the help file doesn't say.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Raven Shier: what kind of rats drone? do you mean a guard drone?
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: wax drone
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Sergeant Cerulean Blue scale: where do you see a wax drone?

[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: Well. I did have one. Now it vanished...
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Sergeant Cerulean Blue scale: oh, chelp wax
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: I did have one, but now it's...vanished? and none of the commands do anything apparent on their own other than give back I don't knows, so I thought there must be some way to start controlling it. but now I'll have to go get another because mine gained its independence lol
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: Wait no it didn't, but I can't see it, probably user error.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Sergeant Cerulean Blue scale: looks like the help file says use the word wax before the commands, like wax enter
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: ...
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: how did I not see this? lol OK.
[Newbie] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: thanks
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Sergeant Cerulean Blue scale: np, glad i could help

[Newbie] Philip Williamson: if your using the info computer the command your looking for is turn info than to use it, the command you're looking for is use info
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Raven Shier: so it says that there's no one here even though there are two pauagiwa in my control room. could that be it? should I report this because I am trying to auth them to my factory.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Sergeant Cerulean Blue scale: they need to be connected

[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i lock a door i've installed?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Dealan Silver scale: Doorl <direction>
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Um...So, I linked my remote unlocker with my ship, and it said it was linked successfully, but then when I tried to use it, it said, "a small beige remote unlocker has not been linked to a ship." What in the world?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: try select remote
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Thanks
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: Hey, I'm trying to set up a moon base, but it's telling me permission denied
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: is it your moon?
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: Yup
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: have your terraformed it/
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: I even popped up to make sure it's registered to me
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: Yeah, I did
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: hmm, that's odd. I'm actually not sure, is this your first mooon base?
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: Yes
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: do you have atmosphere generators set up?
[Newbie] Ada Hopper: It says  I'm not an onwer of this moon when I deploy the atmos gens
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: assist, perhaps?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: can anyone remember the command used to store a spacesuit in the containment field of an airlock?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: oh, never mind. I figured it out.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I forget how to reload plasma torpeedos.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: just do a reload and it should do it for ya.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: it isn't, though, I have plasma, can the launchers only hold 6?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: nope. they hold 10. you have to use what's left before you can reload.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: it looks like when I use check-ammo it doesn't do anything, it won't read my plasma torpedos. what am I doing wrong?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: hmm. I'm not sure. I'd report and ask one of the hosts if I were you.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I'll check more of the docs, maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I can't trash my old red droid, sad.
[Newbie] Lucy Adams: hi how do i repair my trash collecter, it worked the first couple of times, but now it just says Damage negligible.
[Newbie] Nakon Nasaria: must mean it's not damaged enough to need repair
[Newbie] Lucy Adams: i'm still trying to collect yet it won't let me
[Newbie] Nakon Nasaria: that is odd
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: so I take it there's no way to authorise people to vehicles you own? It was suggested to me the other day to try the auth command, but it doesn't work. is there something I'm missing?
[Newbie] Riknagaru Sky blue scale: where I find the upgrade  deep space scanning enhancer
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: I might ask IC for the answer to that question.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you change the color of the fireball as a dragon? Is that a donator item?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Dealan Silver scale: It increases with your level.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Barrister Charlotte Lovelace: it changes color with your level
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Mine is the same as it was at level 1, and I'm like 77 or so.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Dealan Silver scale: I've never paid attention at what point your rank changes your fire. It's an interesting question if someone knows the answer.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you bypass the translator when speaking?
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i see what's in the oven after i'm done cooking?

[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: type refuel and select subatomic

[Newbie] Philip Williamson: how willl I know if the patch listed in help uncharted space is installed?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: which patch?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: In early 2492, Solarblade Industries released a software patch for the automatic movement unit that allows ships to go east and west from any sector, past 6000 and -6000 respectively.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Dealan Silver scale: It's not an upgrade. It just means you can do it now, whereas before this year you couldn't.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Why is it not letting me enter the asteroid field? It says, "you hit forcefield."
[Newbie] Clayton Quinn152099: that just means you forced it into the field or out
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Oooh. How did you do that?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Where is the beacon station for sector 01? I am at 0 0 -50, and scan shows earth, star command, star observation facility, and mercury, but no beacon station.
[Newbie] David Brooks: It's currently not there now.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: most if not all beacon stations are located at 0 0 -50.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Huh? Not there now?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: What in the world?
[Newbie] David Brooks: There is an IC reason for it, but short form was that it blew up.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: When did that occur?
