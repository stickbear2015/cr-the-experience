[Ooc] A formless mass of moonlight : the doctor x rose, worked/ It was a romantic story built up over several episodes that had the reader in love with the story. the watcher, whatever. It was slow, suttle and romantic. It made us go awww they are so perfect, and then cry when rose died. Imade us cheer when they were reunited, and want to strangle the writers when we never heard what he said to her. Where as amy, is cheap. She's a knockoff rose, she's in love with two men, the story doesn't work, her storyline is crap, and to top it all off, she's scottish!
[Ooc] Raven Shier gasps like a fish out of water.

[Ooc] HTPL Olivia Bronze scale: then you'll have to manually gag them
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: wher's the library?
[Ooc] Philip Williamson laughs.
[Ooc] Clayton Quinn152099: that's what i'm trying to tell you on ryeu i don't get them.
[Ooc] HTPL Olivia Bronze scale: business central
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: oh. you're not seeing them and you want to know how to see them again?
[Ooc] Clayton Quinn152099: no. i don't want to see them on this char.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: ok, and, as I said, I use a soundpack to gag them. Or, you could gag them yourself
[Ooc] Steve Dave: Omfg. First server panic in like forever. :(
[Ooc] Clayton Quinn152099: so i'm chasing t his fucking planet to land and since i have a shitty lil newbie ship i can't get to it
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: so, I was going to do a mission, I got the mission, and was in sectar 1 at the stargate. I went through and landed in the ship recycling center. . WTF. I already submitted an assist.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: rofl what?
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: yeah, I know right...
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: do what? oh, that's baaaad!
[Ooc] Clayton Quinn152099: and i'm saying i use a sound pack the same sound pack for this character as i use for ryeu. and on this char i'm seeing these message but on ryeu i don't.
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: possibly a bug, if your using snap's pack, spbug it to submit a possible bug.
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: went through the stargate, and bam, ship recycling center.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: well, in that case, can't help. Sorry
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: haha what the hell. Tyler that's crazed.
[Ooc] HTPL Olivia Bronze scale: if you have assisted, the best you can do is wait
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: I would've been like, uh, what?
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: yeah, talk about a bug... c'mon, nate...
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: that happened to me once. I just assisted.
[ooc] Clayton Quinn152099 left the channel.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: and we all know nate's not perfect. he certainly can't fix every bug even if he does know this game's code better than anyone else. Soooooo...
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: got moved backh.
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: now, I wonder if I'll end up back in the recycling center if i go through the stargate again?
[Ooc] Steve Dave: Lies. Nate is perfect.

[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: Soft!
[Ooc] Tyler Chambliss: well, here goes nothing, if an admin is on the channel, you might have to fix me again, if the bug re occurs.
[Ooc] Jack Gold designation rages.
[Ooc] Host Dante Steel: i am ready to recycle you if it does, dont worry
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: tyler, just assist if you haven't done so already. no need to call for an admin on ooc...
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: haha
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: and that.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: he's not calling for an admin. he's warning them he'll have to assist again.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: rofl
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: heh.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: she's purring now! The kitty, and snuggling with me
[Ooc] Melody Lawson: awwwwww
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: awww kittyyyy!
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: yay snuggle kitty's!
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: she's such a sweetheart. I wanna kidnap her from here and take her home with me!
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: awwww. I don't get to see kitties enough. I've only gotten to hold one maybe...once or twice.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: and one of those times I was holding a kitten. little was just chillin' out on my shoulder.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: er little guy.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: this one doesn't want to be held, but she'll curl up by you, she'll nuzzle the hell out of you and purr like a motor boat. She's an odd one too. She likes when you pull her tail. she'll put it in your hand and walk away so you wind up tugging it. You pull her tail and she purrs. haha
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: you made my soundpack purr!
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: heh
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: pur! yay!
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: purrpurrpurrpurr

[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: yaaaas!
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: awwww.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: hehehehe
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: My kitty's funny, he'll just sit there and chew on you. And he specifically wants to chew on something alive, not an object, he'll pick a person first anyway. He chews kind of hard, just enough to not do any damage, he never tries to do any damage. He just happily gnaws. It's the weirdest thing.
[Ooc] Melody Lawson: awwwww so cute
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: oh wow.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: hahaha. this one likes to grab you by one arm, she'll hold it between all four of her paws, and playfully nibble on you
[Ooc] Steve Dave: As I said, I'm only a cat owner for a month now. But mine's so cute.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: has you kitty ever tried to say no? I saw a video of that once and it was funny as hell.
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: Awwww that's soft, I love kitties with swishy tails.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: and andrea, that is adorable.
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: I knoooooow!
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: had one once that always sounded like he was saying mama, he'd almost never meow. but it could have just been his particular vocalization.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: awww!
[Ooc] Andrea Rimirez: aww. Mama ... how cute
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: Awww I know, it was extra soft.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: I was taking a bath (don't ask), and while I was in the other room waiting for the water to fill up my cat would run into the bathroom, hop up on the tub lid and just sit there staring at the water. I was so worried she was gonna jump in.
[Ooc] Elenhiia Out of Komarova: and it was all questioning the way he inflected it
[Ooc] Steve Dave: tub side**

[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: so thanks to a friend, I'm getting to check out a buzz clip. so far I think it's really kinda neet.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: Fuck the buz clip.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: It's absolutely useless and just another excuse for people to slacken off on using proper mobility.
[ooc] HTPL Dealan Silver scale left the channel.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: I have one too, my school board got me one for free.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: I might not use it all that often. but I may use it some. That in no way implies that I'll be slacking off on my mobility skills.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: And at least it's not an ultracane or a KSonar. I've useda KSonar once, and it's. well, it's odd.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: That sounds like a super advanced evil killing device from space.
[Ooc] Steve Dave boggles at the concept.
[Ooc] A lion named Orran: what's the buzz clip?
[ooc] HTPL Julia Sonders left the channel.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: it's basically a cane attachment tha sends out sound waves that you can listen to through headphones to detect objects. worst idea ever.
[Ooc] A lion named Orran: i don't see how that would work. what if it rains or crossing a street?
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: the buzz clip is this little device that used ultrasound to detect stuff and vibrates to le a user know about what's in frount of them. it's really designed for upper body stuff though.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: and the buzz clip is water resistant but...yeah. as for the KSonar I only used i once hated it.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: er it.
[Ooc] A lion named Orran: what's the sonar one do?
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: basically the same thing, only wit hthe KSonar you have a pair of little ear buds that you have to plug into the device to hear the sound waves it sends out.
[Ooc] A lion named Orran: i don't think i would want to try them.
[Ooc] Steve Dave: Sounds gay.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: it kinda is. why it was developed I'll never know. same with these othr things like the ultracane and the like. for some they might have they're ues, but...
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: other, uses.

[ooc] HTPL Julia Sonders joined the channel.
[Ooc] HTPL Julia Sonders: idol question. Back in the days when native americans had america, they had rain dances. My question is, do you think they ever practiced the rain dance, and if they did practice, how did they know if they got it right or not? Suppose they were parcticing and it started raining. Do you think they said to themselves, "Well no point doing the real thing, next time we want rain we'll just have another practice session." Alternatively what if it didn't rain during the rain dance practice. Do you suppose they assumed they were getting the dance wrong or that the rain god knew it was practice and he was holding the rain for the real dance?
[Ooc] Morgana Le Fay: more importantly, when they danced in the rain, did they sing singing in the rain
[Ooc] Ulysses Battleship gray designation: no, they sing it's raining men
[Ooc] Morgana Le Fay: this storm is amazing, in the course of 5 minutes, it went from broad day light to almost as dark as night, and went from no rain to absolutely tipping it down, like someone had a pressure washer outside my window. then, within the course of another 10 minutes, it's stopped 
[Ooc] Tobias Hamilton: Wow.
[Ooc] Host Dante Steel: it is storming here too
[Ooc] Austin Blake: But, you all need the rain out there like all sorts of badly, right?
[Ooc] Morgana Le Fay: helts yeah

[Ooc] Nakon Nasaria: ah right
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: heh. I can see why it would've been removed.
[Ooc] Stormy White scale: whyle whyle whyle ago
[Ooc] Nakon Nasaria: I just remember their being a sector that used to just be for blowing up shipps.
[Ooc] Stormy White scale: so whats the reason?
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: well, think about it. people would probably go there and kill vacus instead of doing normal missions.
[Ooc] Nakon Nasaria: Sure, but it's not hte same
[Ooc] Stormy White scale jumps up and screams, "Nooooo!"
[Ooc] Nakon Nasaria: We're talking about a sector with probab tons of shipps in it, like you had t be careful jumping in.
[Ooc] Stormy White scale: wen you retreat or what ever they attack the normal sectors
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: aha.
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: yeah, that's a problem
