[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! A few changes have been made to tanks, specifically tank combat. 1. Tanks are no longer area of effect. 2. When a tank targets an object it turns on a tracker that will tell it the objects coordinates every 5 seconds. 3. Each tank weapon now has a rank. 4. Eachh tank weapon can now either only hit at that specific range, or can hit up to that range.  Hopefully this will make tank combat a bit more interesting. There is a help file, help tanks, that gives weapon information. Enjoy!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! In an effort to make volcano harvesting more interesting, we have added an alignment system. Basically sometimes your gear will notch out of alignment, so you need to pay attention in order to nudge it back. It's not drastic, but it's a start. Hope you like it!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! some changes have been made to planet chunks that you need to know of: 1. Artifacts, and all that, now spawn when you land on the planet chunk. Mobs do not spawn until you fix the generator. 2. the time limit has been put back down to 5 minutes, because the running around like a rabbit on speed aspect has been reintroduced. 3. The explosion counter now counts down, so you know how much time you have left. Thanks and enjoy
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! Some changes are being made to the resource market. Please don't touch it for a bit.
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! Regarding the change about tape, I have been advised to remind you all that the tape is only for fun and consentual use only. Anyone caught using it to abuse policies, force role play, or any sticky situations like that, will find their butt on the end of my boot as they go sailing out the door. Just have fun with it and don't be a douche thank you!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! I've just fixed a bug where the moo thought it could be smart with fixing description punctuation. In the process of doing so, I made an error, and some room descriptions have been lost. The hosts will be working as hard as we can to fix this problem. In the mean time, if you see a room with no description, report it please. Thank you!
[announcement] from Lord Parias: hello everyone. Feeding babies appears to be broken. Please report any tracebacks and refrain from feeding them until it's been resolved. thanks
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! So. Docking should be back to about 80 percent functional, in other words, you're welcome to use it again. The changes are also mostly done, though the system does not a few things changed... Mostly message stuff that needs cleaning up. The docking system has been changed such that the messages you get when docking and undocking are a lot more interactive with your character, as well as being more realistic. further more, each one of your ships airlocks now docks to a different point on the tube. Each access tube has, roughly, 20 airlocks for ships to dock to. So if you have a 5 airlock ship, you will need  5 concecutive airlocks in order to dock. It might not seem much, but I'm patting myself on the back and am quite pleased. I hope you enjoy, and let me know via report of tracebacks or anything. thanks!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! Thanks to those who attended the meet and greet. If you missed it, there is a log available through the message boards under the  web board section. 
[announcement] from Ines Donahue: Hello folks, the Mutariansi rp class is over, thanks all for coming, and remember to give us the feedback about the event, if you have something to say!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! So I thought you couldn't rename vehicles, right? I thought i was being really clever and coded it so you could... Accept you already could... So, I have improved the renaming command for vehicles. Enjoy!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys. As per a recent discussion in the host meeting, we have decided to remove the option for custom colours. this is because so many people were taking advantage of this system to enter nonsensickle names such as meow, or things that were really silly. Besides, we were also getting sick and tired of the typos! From now on, the custom field is still there, but it will not allow anything that is not in our colour master list. Never fear! we have 163 options in our list, and we're always adding to it! the  is also quite helpful, so for example if you entered gree, instead of green, it would ask, "did you mean green?" Enjoy!
[announcement] from Lara Stardust: hi guys! Re my last announcement, I have just made it so that colours such as "red and green" or "pink and purple" will still work. Enjoy!
