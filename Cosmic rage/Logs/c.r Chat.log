[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: there is only one time that a repossessed factory was worth the trouble. the factory in question use to belong to that angelika tores as I recall.

[Chat] A large wolf named Miku in a low bark: Tobias! How are you friend?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Honestly, I was gonna gut it for resources and sell it again.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: the factory I speak of had around 800k of all minerals roughly, well over 3 million bricks and liquid, and plastics. I think it had over 6 million wood. It was a starbase.

[Chat] A large wolf named Miku in a low bark: i'm not the greatest, but if you would like assistance, i can help with that.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I haven't even finished the interior of my factory let alone furnished my ships.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that be awesome. I'll definitely let you know when I'd like to do that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I can't stand my ships being unfurnished. and yet my battle charger is, as far as I can remember. I'll have to fix that.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: you try having to find fancy furniture to go with a starliner.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: true.
[Chat] A large wolf named Miku chuckles:  I'm sure it could be done.
[Chat] Antonia Romano: hello all.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] A large wolf named Miku in a low bark: hello there.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: 96 rooms, well, the cargo holds don't need it, or certain other areas.
[Chat] Bryan Maxwell: Hey.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yeah. I'd only furnish the important rooms (state rooms and the like).

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I think when the time comes for me to et a pinnacle and starliner, I may be contacting folks for help making them look good.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: because my fashion sense, isn't. if that makes any sense.
[Chat] Denny Chandler groumbles loudly:  damn it... need 4 more microdrones. Guess it's back to the runway for me.
[Chat] Denny Chandler laughing:  or I could just punch the shit out of the crabs.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yeah, that works too.
[Chat] Denny Chandler sounds of a scuffle:  ow, you son of a bitch... that's my finger!
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: kill them crabs, denny. make all those crabs into a very tasty crab cake. Then, eat the cake.

[Chat] Philip Williamson: it lets everyone know to be careful if flying around the sector your in, and well if you still don't pay attention or aren't paying attention to general? well, in my mind that's on you, not me.

[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Got it.
[Chat] Glaroc Aqua designation in a chitter: I know that I may not be the most experienced pilot ever, do does anyone need help in the places where invasion is trying to destroy the sectors? I am not going to lie, I have been waiting for action for the last couple of months, because harvesting everyday is incredibly boring, but it is the only way I can repay my large amount of debt.
[Chat] Glaroc Aqua designation in a chitter: it would seem that ev erything has already been taken care of.
[Chat] David Brooks: Hi.

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: oh, the tabloids. They'll take anything they hear and run with it.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: eh, knowing the general he probably just let it slip out. Lord knows everyone under his command is a maggot. And I think the only sdl officer he might not call maggot is Chief General Kayla, but she has a temper and might eat him for dinner with a small salad, so I don't quite blame.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone Is there a place where i can buy a cargo bay expansion drone on Calira Dura**9*1, or do i need to go to some other planet?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I purchased the first core chunks upgrade, but it didn't come with the gear, where do I get the core gear from? for star coring?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: where'd you go?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I want to say Neptune.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I got the upgrade from earth. I'll check out neptune, do you know what store?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: There's only one store on Neptune.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: it's one of those gas giants. I just suggest going to all of them. But meh. Kinda pricy to do it that way.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: is their a more cost effective solution to get the upgrades?
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: nope.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: instead of running to each giant?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: For an armor shop for every need, they don't really cover the need of unusually shaped forms.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] Philip Williamson: yay I got the upgrade!
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Heya, Vaz...
[Chat] Philip Williamson: where on the factory complex on Eexei Othairus are shock absorbers?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: never mind!
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: where do i go to get all the upgrades for my cargo expansion drone?
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: think there's an upgrade place on Goscro Crah.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: There's a store on Goscro Crah that sells them.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: it's called Cut throat something or other.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Thanks.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Cutthroat’s Cargo I think.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: What was the planet called that has the shop that sells the cargo drone upgrades again?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Goscro.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: The place whhere most pilots go.   hand mining. Home planet of the Ryuchi.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: You warp sir. warp whatever speed you need to.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Or whatever your rank for the warp skill is.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: i don't think i can warp. I'm in the basic ship of my race, a dicrasla.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Odd, i'm at Goscro Crah's coordinates, but for some reason, my computer is telling me that there are no landable objects in range when i tell it to land. Furthermore, when i try to enter the gravity well of Goscro Crah, it says that there is nothing with a gravity well in range. How strange, eh?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: the planet is orbiting, please chase.
[Chat] David Brooks: Planets do move you know.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: it likely orbitted from whereever you rifted to.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Well, i think it did, but i set course to where it moved to, and it's giving me the same results.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: My advice, scan that planet again. then hit the COURSE LAST button on your console to set your ships course to the same as the current coordinates. then use your speed engines to fly there at max speed.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: it's still moving.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: I find that planets like Goscro Crah move around too much. Plus, i'm running out of time and am gonna need to land soon.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: just wait until you can get the chasing upgrade.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: If you want some help, I can give your ship a quick tug.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Please, if you could.grav.
[Chat] Matt Hunter: type plan Goscro.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: What's your ship's name?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows over the sounds of a cart rattling, explosions bursting in the background, and the sounds of a turret firing:  I need to wear ear plugs before getting on this cart.
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: I'd say so.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I'm having trouble finding you.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Oh, think a missile exploded on this cart.
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: oops.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: You okay?
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Actually, i just jumped to the planet's current coordinates, and was able to enter its gravity well. I am now landed on the planet.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Okay.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Now then, what's the name of that shop that sells the cargo expansion drone upgrades?
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale Sounding slightly annoyed:  Someone already told you.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Cut Throat's Cheap Cargo.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Yeah, at least an hour ago.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: crud, i din't know that i needed to have the drone i was gonna upgrade with me.
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: Um. Yeah... You do...
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: well, i'll have to come back tomorrow. i'm out of time for today.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I mean... you were going to upgrade the cargo drone... without the cargo drone...
[Chat] Snapp Blue scale Sounding as if he's trying to hold back laughter:  Yeah. That's totally going to work. I think I'll try that.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton giggles and transmits:  hey, you never know. technology could improve so that could be a thing. I doubt it though.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Can someone plesae make a helper drone for me? I'm getting close to rank 300.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Anybody want to hang out?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Hi. Everyone.

[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I really wish there was a way for me to get my moon out of a bloody bubble.
[Chat] David Brooks: How come? YOu are much better off building things up. Trust me.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: according to the manuals, it will stay taht way for 14 days.
[Chat] David Brooks: And if I understand things right, that time is a really good time to build things up seeing that that is about the only time of peace with it you will get.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ask jitel what happened to her's if you want to know.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: hers?
[Chat] David Brooks: Ment hhis.
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: Nearest jump point was 0 1 0. Went there and still couldn't use my jumpdrive.
[Chat] David Brooks: You will need to either rift back or fly back. if you are going to rift back, find yourslef a plant that someone had left laying around.
[Chat] David Brooks: Someone might be doing dark matter mining out there somewhere and might not want to weist time getting out there.
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: That's fine, I'll attempt to do as much on my own.
[Chat] David Brooks: How far out are you?
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: 2 from zero.
[Chat] David Brooks: It should not take you that long to get back.
[Chat] David Brooks: When you get one from zero, run like hell if you are coming in veia the west or the east.
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: If I go west from WP1, am i coming in? I can't remember the direction i came out here.
[Chat] David Brooks: Are you -1 or 1.
[Chat] David Brooks: that would tell you.
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: Still at 2. I'm at WP1. I guess +1.
[Chat] David Brooks: You are going at warp 1?
[Chat] David Brooks: That is kind of slow.
[Chat] Joshua Matthews: Oh no. I'll be going at 15 when I do go. At least I hope that's what AMU is doing.
[Chat] David Brooks: Amu should be using warp 15.
[Chat] David Brooks: Who is flying Solar Strike?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: which stables has the food for horses? Star command just has horse treets.
[Chat] David Brooks: Not to sure on that.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Kaldara food for horse.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Kaldara should have horse food.
[Chat] Ross Brown39557 in a drone: where are some planets with mechanical mining sites?
[Chat] Riknagaru Sky blue scale in a growl: Does the Star studies activity have any problems? I went to a star and she's not attracting the ship ...

[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: i may be needing a medic within the next...
[Chat] Courtney Mayes transmits a gasp of pain
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: How you can be GMC. It is a planet.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: awww, I hope you will be okay.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation snorts
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is also organization.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: oh god...
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: What's wrong Courtney?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: thankfully the plane is arriving.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: just...this baby...she's letting me know she's just about ready to make her entry into this world.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: date of arrival?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: I'm guessing within the next two days.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: congrats.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Absolutely. Congradulations.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: blessings of light on child.
[Chat] Austin Blake: So, I wonder how long it will take my factory to refine the 1528000 pieces of debris in it.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: wo!
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is lot of debris.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: more than a day, I think.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Hmm...
[Chat] Austin Blake: Would have put it up for auction, or on the market, but both seem to be saturated and there's no interest.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: That really is a lot of debris.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I honestly have no idea.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: why not keep for factory, use it could you.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I can, and probably will. Until such time as the market isn't so overloaded.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Part of that will go toward moon enhancements.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: what are those "jump points" you see in docking bays of some ships?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Industrial plants, possibly?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is good plan, would be enough think Jerore.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: How did you carry so much? Multiple trips or all in one go?
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Debris, I mean.
[Chat] Austin Blake: The sacks Are easy move sacks, still i imagine it is condensed down quite tightly.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: anybody want to play poker?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Night all.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Damnit, I need stun crystals.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: :a ponderous silence, then, "So... I need resources and was considering taking the plunge and trying out chunks, but I've a few questions that weren't covered in full in the manual I read on them. How big are they? And, is it possible to fight off aliens and find a hidden exit all in 8 minutes?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: I'm going to explain a little something. Forgive me if i sound like a grumpy person but i feel it must be said. If i have not met or communicated with you in some fashion over one of the various chatter channels, please do not send link requests. I will not accept them until we have met face to face or spoken over comms.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: .with a trace of amusement, "I'm right there with you. It's... odd..."
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation yawns
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Need to do something, but what to do.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: indeed. i wish i wasn't stuck in this darn bed!
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Crush it.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes laughs
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Nice, warp 2. I know what to do now.
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Rainbow in a soft mew: hmmm.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: What about Hello?
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Rainbow in a soft mew: yes, and hi hi.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: These Maraqudan people are really full of paranoid.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: they are!
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Why? what's wrong?
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: These fucking guards do not let me walk in my spacesuit. It's stupid Maraquda things.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: This Maraqudan language is strange.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: oh how i love these classic cars!
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Rainbow in a soft mew: nice.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: would anyone like to see this beauty of a car?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I would.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: I am at sahariana for those who would like to join me.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: So... are chunks possible to do solo?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: so...anyone interested in joining us?
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: hi hi galaxy.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: hello oro.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: hi there.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: awake from a small nap, what's up anyways.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hi all.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: nothing too interesting...we are just sitting here at saharinai.
[Chat] Yaslene Webster transmits a single click over the link.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: I see I see.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: sahariana i mean...this coffee hasn't kicked in.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: I'm not doing much, just sitting somewhere.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: you could come hang out with me and courtney?
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: sure.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: we're on Sahariana, in the lounge.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: morning...i'm not very awake. how's everyone?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: i am well...and yourself?
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: struggling to wake.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: aha!

[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: well, if you want, we can meet to talk.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: i'm actually working on a factory at present, but i'd be happy to holocon at some point if you're interested.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: sure thing.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: you design factories? or you're working on your own?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: i design factories and clothing...although i'm currently working on a factory.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: oh, then we surely need to talk!
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: fantastic!
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: you have your own factory? i'd like to visit.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: I do, though it isn't open yet. I've been more focused on helping others with theirs before i complete mine.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: aww, i see. Well, can't wait to see yours.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: thank you!
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: mind if i grab a com's link?
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: go for it.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: mind if I get one too, mam? Maybe we have one already.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: go for it, and feel free to call me annellin.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Nice to meet you.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: nice to meet you too.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: oh. we have a link! That's awesome.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: so...i've got a bunch of alfozen68 to get rid of if anyone needs it...as well as some other ratika extermination equipment.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Is there a way someone can run out of a blue print?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: yes...
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Can someone sell me an anti rat nester one? or a few?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: and if so, how much would you want for them?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: or should I put them on the order manager?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: anyone know where I can buy a malulial scanner module?
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: seem no store sell that one.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I think that's at um, maracuta. sam's scanners.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I think?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: it is not. I thought much the same thing. And Sam does not sell those.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Oh.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: now where did i see that upgrade...
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: doing good. THanks. How are you?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: no matter. I will see if I can find them.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Fuck it, I need 1 tril.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I used to be able to get quad from debris but the prices slowed.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: annellin, it was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you enjoy your outfit I designed for you.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: it was a pleasure meeting you too, sweetheart! And yes, i love it.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: wonderful to hear!
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: oh...oh i have a wonderful idea! Aha! Yes this will work it will!
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: oh?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: Keep your marketing channel tuned in, you'll see in a few moments!
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: okaaaay?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: there we go! Now i just need to add things to it.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: amazing!
[Chat] David Brooks: It really takes less from belts to make my fuel if I get stuff from stars. Nice.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: what do the ratika traps actually do? II haven't figured that out. and the defense drones. I know what the guard ones do.
[Chat] Kostas Karansakis: hios.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: hello there.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: is david brooks around by any chance?
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: Looks like someone's trying out those old earth classic cars over here.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: fantastic! my portfolio is complete.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: now, i sleep.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hello all.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: Hey there.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: O my! Anyone on mars?
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: be safe out there.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone How are itchy scales related to water pods? *through laughter*.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: Uh, oh, let me see whose containers Garry got...
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale yawns:  Hello all.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Heya...
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Ok, planing to build a hous at Aeloriana.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: Looks like Garry looks a bit anoyed.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: i'm so proud of this little portfolio!
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hey how goes?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: it goes well.
[Chat] Austin Blake: What's this project your working on?
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: see adverts.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Ooo, nice! Good luck with it.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: nice!
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: the ad sounds interesting and nice.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I'm still working on the apartment I have on star command but once it's done, I'll have to give you a buzz, courtney.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: you're welcome to.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: where are the advert documents saved on my info computer when I tap "yes" to the prompt asking me if I want to save the document?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I still need to talk with a couple of the guys about adding in a couple more bedrooms, bathrooms and closets, plus a study as well. We're trying to figure out legistics like room location and stuff. I'm also trying to decide on lighting for some of the rooms. I have the pool and garage lit how I want, but...meh.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: I wonder when Research Complex was built.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I'm trying to get an airplane, but, I'm not finding it in my shopping guide?
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: Well, search for Airbus, and you'll get to it.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Thanks my man.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: no problem.
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: I wonder if the loading bay still exists on Sola Virtus Invicta...
[Chat] Harry Brooks152131 in a drone: where is Jake the snake? I've looked in the lake but can't find him, is he hiding somewhere else?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Woh, we got a nice fire going on on maraquda's landing pad.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Fire? How?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: On my way.
[Chat] Austin Blake: If I had to guess I'd say someone's vehicle is going up, and the smoke is intense.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: How bad is fire?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I am on my way, hold on.
[Chat] David Blue scale in a growl: I've been trying to make specialist equipment for myself, with no success.
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: This bacon sandwich isn't so terrible.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: o, hello.
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: Greetings.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: What is she saying?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What who say?
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: Marenne.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Marenne?
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: Did someone call me?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Yes. Marenne need get mutariansi translator so mutariansi able understand Marenne.
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: Ahh yes, I did get one.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I can understand her now.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Ok.
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: I don't suppose any of you might know of a Miss Ramirez? a counselor?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias only know Andrea Ramirez. Andrea doctor.
[Chat] Marenne Capaletti: Ahh, yes, that is who I am referring to. Dr. Ramirez.
[Chat] A human named Mileta in an amazonian accent: I don't believe she's awake... or might be just meditating.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Hrm, should I bother with the MKII weapon platform drone thingies?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: where can I get waste armor?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: You'll have to make waist armor yourself.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: Hello.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: hi.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Austin Blake, are you awake?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows a hello
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Hi Vaz.
[Chat] A tigress named Camille meows:  "Hello"
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale rumbles a hello back
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a bark:  what's with the meowing?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Because the felines now rule the moment.
[Chat] A tigress named Camille in a deep growl: amen brother.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it's the standard feline greeting vocalization.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: How money have lines?
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: I will be auctioning off a gown made for dragons in a little while. Would anyone be interested in one to begin with?
[Chat] David Brooks: I am wondering something. How far out does these radios reach into deep space again?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Depends on industrial plants.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I have a comm booster installed on mine, so you're good at least to uc 64 128 256, and I'm sure others have boosters further out.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ok, what is the farthest plant?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: That I do not have an answer to.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am thinking I might want to find out...
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I've heard something about 1000 1000 1000, but haven't tried going out that far.
[Chat] David Brooks: that is far.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Yeah. I wouldn't want to imagine going out that far.
[Chat] David Brooks: I would have to hit every belt I find on the way out if I am to make it.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Or have a lot of canisters. Or take a long time.
[Chat] David Brooks: It takes awhile to refine the needed quantum fuel.
[Chat] David Brooks: Of course, having the cargo bays full plus a few other things help...
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Warp doesn't need nearly as much fuel, and it's easier to get.
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes, but it does not go as fast.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Wasn't a problem for us early explorers.
[Chat] David Brooks: true.
[Chat] David Brooks: Before I think about working my way into deep space, I think a scanner from Maraquda will do.
[Chat] David Brooks: Has anyone tracked down a malulial?
[Chat] David Brooks: AMU does use the fastest speed possible if I have the system set to use the quantum drive right?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Yes.
[Chat] David Brooks: Good.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am out here hunting for something interesting.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Good luck finding it.
[Chat] David Brooks: I doudt I will, but I will give it a try.
[Chat] David Brooks: Should have just enough to get back when it comes time to turn around.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: This dress is made only for dragons.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Want to bet at least half the bids come from other species?
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: Or not at all. I will reauction another time if it doesn't sell.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: That is probably directly linked to the number of people who actually give a damn about the auctions.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I certainly don't care about them. I've seen some pretty ridiculous things on them.
[Chat] David Brooks: Uggg. Looked over on the correct screen here and I see that I will not be passing any malulials this trip.
[Chat] Zerthus Bright gold scale in a growl: sad.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am going to see if this quantum fuel is worht the time I took to gather it though.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I can't do much deep space stuff yet, sadly. ah well.
[Chat] David Brooks: Wish you told me sooner, I would had brought you with me.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: Heh. I'm only rank 363. I could only have acted as a gunner or engineer.
[Chat] David Brooks: But you would had saw what I see out here.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: maybe.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: well, I'm heading out into deep space to try and find Malulial stuff.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: I am hanging out in local space to enduldge myself.
[Chat] David Brooks: You might try over at 160, 203, -148.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol coughs
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: I was thinking there. Though might go for the one hanging out in -10 down. Seems closer over all.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: either that or just a longer flight.
[Chat] David Brooks: At this stage, I am seeing if my ship is up to long flights by giving it a small test run per say.
[Chat] David Brooks: I really love the quantum drive.
[Chat] David Brooks: It looks like I will be coming up on Horizon Skyline in a bit. It is placed around 15 units away from the plant I rifted too.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Ahh alright.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: I think I may have to fly directly out from locals and run the blockade.
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes, it looks like you will.
[Chat] David Brooks: I am somewhere between 6 to 7 hundred units out of locals.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: alright. I got some chairs and tables to bolt down in my ship so that I don't have to sit on the floor the entire time.
[Chat] David Brooks: I hope you have enough fuel to make the run.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: I have enough to run the blockade back and forth. But I a stocking up on warp crystals for normal quantum flight using warp fuel. Want to conserve what I have made for the important bits.
[Chat] David Brooks: How many tanks of crystels would you suggest for trips that long?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: i have one, but I am buying a bunch of level five to refill the tank if it runs empty.
[Chat] David Brooks: where to put them all is my problem.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: I always put the tanks in either cargo bay 5A or 5D, if you are flying a starliner. Just go south from the bridge, use the inship teleporter to the vehical garage, go east or west into one of the hangars, and north to the cargo grid.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have one tank there. Just as you suggest. I am thinking about buying one more to put on the other side to have extra at hand. Then again, I can always stop to make more.
[Chat] David Brooks: fuel that is if I wanted to save the warp crystels.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: wait wait, what are you guys trying to do?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: where can you get a starliner?
[Chat] David Brooks: Bring up the shopping menu of your info computer and go down to the starship search. It should give you the list of ships. Choose it from that list and you will know.
[Chat] David Brooks: I had 750000 units of advanced quantum fuel and around 90000 of the basic stuff. I am steal going after 30 UC.
[Chat] David Brooks: It seems like there is a plant every ten Universal coordinates apart.
[Chat] David Brooks: I made it to Bakuan5. Think it is time for me to park this ship to get a little rest. The fuel I made is good. The quantum drive does hold out well when it has the right fuel.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Nice. How far were you able to get? And how much fuel did you use going there?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: price is not an issue, but could someine make me a basic, and advanced quantum refinery and both types of fuel for me?
[Chat] David Brooks: Let's see, made it 40 units. burnd 90750 units of basic quantum fuel and 389928 of advanced quantum fuel. Does that answer your question?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: yes. that answers it perfectly.
[Chat] David Brooks: when I say 40 units, I am talking about Universal coordinates mind you. Is that good range for you?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Much better than warp. Going that same distance, you would have had to refill your warp fuel tank several times at that point.
[Chat] David Brooks: And I did not have to refuel at all.
[Chat] David Brooks: And if I recall right, it was over an hour of burning said fuel.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: very nice. seems our research prooved useful.
[Chat] David Brooks: I was worried that the drive might break on me or something.
[Chat] David Brooks: Philip, you could send a mail to jitel to see if he will make it for you. Not to sure what he will charge for it though.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Now that looks quite lovely. Just watched my railguns tear up several attack ships on screen.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: nom nom.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Not a bad haul. Nine warp crystals and seven subatomic crystals.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: and a sack of minerals.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: damn. all these merchant ships launching from goscrocra.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: er.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: they sure do frequant that planet.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: goscro cra, even.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh, they seem to like it, a lot.
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble: does anyone have any large batches of batteries made.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: how many? and what type, ship or flashlight?
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble: ship.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: a moment.
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble: and as many as i can get.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I have ten available, how much are you willing to part with?
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble: i am having a bit of trouble with money at the moment. But i don't know how much those usually go for.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: what rank are you?
[Chat] Methelius Black gold designation in a firm commanding rumble: 947.

[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Ryuchi? They have a long and upsetting history with them, and that came to a head last year.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: best we could do is to make it so that ryuchi could go there again but get taxed. and eventually, we managed to figure out something so that your people could go free.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: and by we, I mean our government.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias glad that happen.

[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: it does, sir.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I'm not a sir, that would be my father who is 6 feet under.
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: I'd honestly rather be taxed then have to ask another pilot to deliver me things from there, as some things can only be gotten there.

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: something tells me that if he were still alive today, he'd make more than a few enemies.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: oh he had several.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: beating women is just all kinds of fucked up. Those who do it should be beaten and killed in their turn.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Agree Tobias does. Tobias no like people get hurt by others. Tobias have that while slave. Not any more.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: the man had 6 x wives, and several hundred mistresses through out his life. He has several illegitimate children. In other words, he had some baby mamas.

[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: your fucking stuipid if you think i'll buy a treat for that much.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: if you were dying, maybe you would by it? but even then. hmm.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: that is terribly overpriced and most likely filled with fillers that are not good for your pets.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I do not own a pet, otherwise I might enjoy giving it to them.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Also, the price.
[Chat] Ixa Umber designation in a chitter: is there no where on the info computer that tells where mining planets are?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: The library.

[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: That's completely different.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Oh. I am sorry. My information is overloading.
[Chat] Ixa Umber designation in a chitter: so no research place on harmonia looks like.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Research place for what again?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Right, gems. Like from a volcano?
[Chat] Ixa Umber designation in a chitter: gems.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Oh, I completely forgot that was a thing... I have no idea. I suppose you don't just transfer them from a mooring?
[Chat] Ixa Umber designation in a chitter: this is from hand mining.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Oh, then there's a place on Goscro Crah just  either east or west of the landing pad. Don't remember which offhand.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I do not like this slave area on Temreth. Very unsettling.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: I don't like slave areas at all.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I have not set foot on that planet since the first day it was rediscovered.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Why are their slaves there?
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: I don't understand.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Why is that? Because of slavery, or other problems?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Because the leaders are assholes.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: They need abolished.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Oh the Glass city is not that bad.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: The mountain one however.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I like the glass city, except there are no outdoor areas within it.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: When I saw that not only did they have slaves but how badly they were treated, I started to enter an anger loop that would have... ended badly.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: What I'd do, is try to help the prisinors with whatever I could.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: glass city needs at least an outdoor area or 2, so i can fly about.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Get them out of there.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: it is covered I mean... you can't break a hole in the fish bowl.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: It would seem not.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: I tried, failed, I crashed into the glass ceiling.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Not my proudest moment.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: oh dear.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Not good.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I've seen domed cities in other dimensions with airlock structures specifically to allow passage for high-altitude objects.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: At the moment, the only place to purchase defensive upgrades is Temreth, much to my growing displeasure.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: As much as possiblle, I build my own.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I grow weary of being thrown down the steps off this landing pad.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: It is making me angry.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale growls threateningly
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale swears loudly:  I am not this clumsy. Ever. Why here?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: being shoved sort of helps in knocking one over.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Two separate incidences.
[Chat] Jimmie Smith: hi.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hello.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: if you all see a cat that happens to be in the military and he's strutting like he just won the lottery, I have nothing to do with it.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale chuckles deeply
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale grumbles
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Don't hate Lance Corporal. All that occured was that i was forced to get groomed.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale chuckles again
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: definitely not forced. you started falling asleep partway through it.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: my repairs are at 1500 but my mark II is at 2000 what upgrade am I missing?
[Chat] Jimmie Smith: hi. I need help. I'm trying to find a landing pad, but I don't know where one is. I'm currently in the town square, on earth.

[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: You're looking for the top of the rock.
[Chat] SDL private Calpurnia Malik sounding slightly angry:  Top of that rock, along the path and past the trash heaps.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale transmits a long pause.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I am just... just.....
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Im speechless.
[Chat] Nakon Nasaria: Who would spend that much.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: It is....
[Chat] Philip Williamson: a little rich for my blood, considering I have a baby on the way.
[Chat] Jimmie Smith: I made it to the top of the rock, where do I have to go now?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: That is the pad.
[Chat] Jimmie Smith: oh. sorry.
[Chat] Jimmie Smith: I need help with finding a mining shop. I'm on the planet Maraquda.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: I think i'm going to camp out.
[Chat] Ross Brown39557 in a drone: where do I buy the debris upgrade for the cargo drone?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: On goscro crah.

[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Is there a public store where one may buy a debris laser?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Shy's Royal Revolutionaries, at Bright Star Industries.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: you can search for those things using your nfo comp under privately owned shops.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Ah, privately owned shops. Understood.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I was not sure.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I know that Toptanci Industries has them.
[Chat] Ross Brown39557 in a drone: where can I buy the chasing upgrade?
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I'm not sure. I'm sorry.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: anyone know which battlestation has the computer system upgrade? I've been to what seems like most of them and I can't find it.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Could I have some assistance getting a plant of some sort to help cure ratika poison? This is quite painful.
[Chat] Syuri Dark green scale in a growl: sure hang on a moment.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I am looking, and not finding anything.

[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: someone can help?
[Chat] Grake Donoven: what do you need to help with?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: probably best to take an escape pod and retrieve your ship once you return to civilization.

[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: perhaps I shall. But I don't know much about MI so maybe looking into that will also help.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: understand.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I will not talk about this on public channels, sorry .
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: uh, damn it.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: can't believe i've just crashed my starship.
[Chat] Jim Green designation sighs
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: ouch.
[Chat] David Brooks: Here we go again. You turned off your power?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yes, forgot i was orbiting.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: dude, just land before you sleep.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i was installing a module, no sleeping.
[Chat] Jim Green designation chuckles
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: damn it, all that money i put into that ship.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: well, land while you install the module then. or don't bloody orbit.
[Chat] David Brooks: I do not know why people just do not look out the windows.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: and you didn't save its design in a dry dock, did you?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i don't have a factory, so .
[Chat] David Brooks: Another factory is selling access to a drydock.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: don't they have public dry docks somewhere?
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: what are we talking about.
[Chat] David Brooks: They do, but do not recall here.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i'm honestly not sure.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: uh oh.
[Chat] Jim Green designation sighs:  i just crash a ship, stormy is all.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: you just crashed a ship?
[Chat] David Brooks: Thought I saw a advert somewhere at some time.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: that's what i just said.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: you can save them on starsong.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: there are many public drydocks available, you also can find them at toptanci if its the question.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: any time I install a module or a bigger ship batery or whatever, I head on over to a dry dock and hit that Save button.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: thanks, but it's gunna take me a while now to get that back.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: the joys.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: what ship was it?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: premium miner.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: i can help you get one if you want.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: whats the cost of ðit .
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: that would mean i oh you though, an i'm already trying to pay of 82 billion.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: er off.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: can we meet at navu?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: uh well, sure.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: give me 2 minutes, sir?
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: that works.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: heading your way now, stormy.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: how leave uncharted space.
[Chat] David Brooks: YOu near a factory?
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: no.
[Chat] David Brooks: You come back the same way you left.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: i am totally lost.
[Chat] David Brooks: Set your course to 0 0 -50.
[Chat] David Brooks: That should take you to a beacon station.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: thank dave.
[Chat] David Brooks: No prob. Just watch out for stars.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh, stars are dagerous i here.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: danerous, even.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: thank.
[Chat] David Brooks: I do not know if there is a star in your path or not.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: dangerous, even.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: i will watch.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: I think the ship computer will tell you if you lay in a course that passes through a star.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: but nevertheless, watch out.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: i will be safe in 1 hour.
[Chat] David Brooks: YOu do not have warp?
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: no.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: where are you?
[Chat] David Brooks: What is your coords, and from what sector are you in.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: you can't evacuate your ship?
[Chat] David Brooks: that butten labled sector should help you some.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: uc is 0.48, 1.48 0.48.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: what about gc?
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: sector 1: -213, -119, -221.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ok, you are not that far off. Try scanning for planets.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: oh yes you're very close.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: stop your speed.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: done.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: ok when I come close dock to me.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: ok you can dock now. Do a docking bay dock.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: ok now where do you need to go?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: what is the name of your ship.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: earth.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: we'll be ther ein 30 seconds.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: ugh, 30 seconds.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: ok.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: there you go, you're on earth.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: thank.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: you're welcome.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: with this ship i don't need to use the heat-shields.
[Chat] David Brooks: Hmmmm. every ship I bought, I had to use the heatshields.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: can you retrofit a ship with another cargo bay?
[Chat] David Brooks: doubt it.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: not if you already have another on it.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: at least, that's what I was told when I wanted to upgrade my star of avalon.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: ah. Well I wanted more storage for my minerals and debris on my miner but I guess I'll have to wait to build a custom ship.
[Chat] David Brooks: Or you can shop around.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: I saw that the premium miner had two bays, does it not?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: true enough. The thing is the miner already comes with most of the stuff I want so finding one with more than 2 cargo bays will be tough, and then I'll have to upgrade everything.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: yes, it does. But it makes for having to return to unload all too often.
[Chat] David Brooks: I have heard that friend ship was selling ships with more than one bay.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: i always get lost on harmonia.
[Chat] David Brooks: your mapper should help with that.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Pods are useful.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: oh i know, but you saw this place?
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: yes, using pods. most of the time.
[Chat] David Brooks: Pods are usefull if you can get access to one.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I miss those recall consoles. I went on vacation and then I came back and they were gone.
[Chat] Retired SDL Sergeant Annellin Starlight: tell me about it.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: but walking allows you to see the beauty around you!
[Chat] David Brooks: Well, aircraft can help you out some.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I wonder how I could arrange a meeting to meet some of you and also work on my song?
[Chat] David Brooks: do not know.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I just thought of something.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I could build a hut and let whoever wanted to meet me come see it.
[Chat] David Brooks chuckling:  that might work.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: can anybody tell me where i might find the information about what factory has the highest price for debris use my info computer?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: er using.
[Chat] David Brooks: Has anyone gone out into deep space to rescue starships? I am talking about going out for those cruisers that love to take people out for the fun of it.
[Chat] David Brooks: Just wondering how it worked out for you.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ugg, what's the best thing to cure poison?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: PICK plants at a landing pad.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ugg, i can't seem to find anythiing!
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Make sure you study about biology some in the books. That will help you learn how to find plants.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ugg, i died, yet again.
[Chat] David Brooks: From what this time?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: poison.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ugg.
[Chat] David Brooks: Has anyone done any starship rescuing?
[Chat] Olivia Bronze scale in a gentle rumble: I have not tried, personally. I am not skilled enough.
[Chat] David Brooks: I may be at that point within the next month or so and I am trying to figure out the draw backs are.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: no I'm not good enough yet.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: blast, wrong channel.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: what's the name of the store that sells the cargo bay expansion drone upgrades on Goscro Crah?
[Chat] Ross Brown39557 in a drone: cutthroats cheap cargo.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: can you add weapon rooms to a starship?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: what is an enemy sub base?
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Hello, members of the Galaxy! I've woken up... For now.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello Emilee.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: hi Emilee.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Hello hello hello. What's going on. Anything exciting?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: just destroying enemies here.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: that sounds like fun...
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: I love it.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Missions, I assume?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: yet.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Aha. that's the life.
[Chat] Nelson Orange scale in a growl: mutters something about air vehicle drivers and lack of manners.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: someone tell me to go for a lack and i don't know why.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I am not on the ship any more.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: so the safety report shows.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello sister.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: hi brother.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: but I am good with doing something else I am so close to my next rank.
[Chat] Normann Dans149603 in a drone: i must find this place.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hello all.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Hello Lance Corporal.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: hello sir.
[Chat] Lydia Gray designation in a chitter: hello.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Jitel, hello!
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hey hey.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: hmm, what to do.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: I'm wondering the same thing.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: well then. i'm gunna guess i've just met a pirate for the first time in a field.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: woopee... not.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale transmits a long pause.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: need some help getting rid of them?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: nah, they've gone. there was only 1, but thanks.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: What...the...fuck? Please tell me that my ship is malfunctioning. If it's not, I have no clue where in the hell I am.
[Chat] Denny Chandler chuckles:  damn, and I was hoping to deep fry it with my solar cannon.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ah, well i'm terribley sorry about that!
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: tannon. Where is your ship telling you you are? Use the GC button.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: This cannot be right. My ship says that I am in "simulation sector." Universal coords show as 2,147,483,647.52, 34.50, 2,147,483,647.50. What the hell?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: uh oh, what happened before you found yourself there?
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Upon which merchant ship can cows be purchased? Does anyone know?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: yes. that is quite odd.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: that is qiite odd indeed.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: er quite.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: sorry, i just fell on the floor.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Beta, maybe?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: So the 64 quad question is, how the hell do I navigate?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it may be time for the pod and a retrevial.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: er, retrevial.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh, do you have any escape pods?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Perhaps apply for a technition's request. Or do that. though that will be a long pod ride back.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Is there a way to set course in terms of universal coordinates?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: no. You will have to navigate through there. But at your current rank, it would take you several months to fly back. I am sure you would not want to do that. A pod might take upwards of two hours. Though I can't be sure.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: what were you doing when you ended up where you are now?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I went out to a planetoid field.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: at least with the pod, you will have a chance to get your ship back, I think.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I would prefer not to lose my ship.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Though, given what my sensors are telling me, it might need to spend some time in an engineering bay, as something seems severely impaired.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: understandable, but if memory serves me, there's a way to get it back... I say I think, as I'm not sure if that applies to ships that far out.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: uhm this teleportation thing has problems.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: it suddenly can't find mulrala.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: It's still here.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: ignore that I am so stupid.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: as am I here.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: at mulrala.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: where do you get the upgrades for the cargo expansion drones?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: cheep cargo on goscro cra.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: Cuthroat's Cargo on Goscro.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: thank you.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: yup, the ryuchi home planet.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: why does my mapper say below the large rock is east and I can not even go east.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: this place is confusing.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I am lost in the wastelands.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: there should be a north exit but I can find none.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: can someone please help me before my trash truck loses charge?
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: I can.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I appreciate it.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: what is the matter?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I am lost in the wastelands.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: that point when you want to purchase something's from the resource market and don't have the ship capacity!
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: do you require extra help?
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: I'll be there in a moment.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: what's your truck called?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: not sure, I just know I need to get out of here before I lose charge.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: well I need to know the name of your truck so I can find you.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I am watching you fight it is precious freedom.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: right. then just head east.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: now up.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: thanks.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: of course.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I wonder if I could ram those monsters to death with my truck.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: sigh.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I wonder if I dare try to ram the truck into this monster.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: battle station alpha 3 indicates it's at 0 -500 -100 in sector 11, Im' here but no station.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: yay it worked I rammed that monster to death.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: that gives me much peace of mind.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hello all.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: hello.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: ah. It only has four. that's good enough for now, I suppose.
[Chat] Titus Pendragon131837 in a drone: Where can i get the starship upgrade to allow for debris scanning?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: you need to get the scanning module from maraquda.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: so I have a strange question, when reviewing my ships skematics, the starliner, they show 11 weapons rooms. but actually counting them, I only see six, plus two auxiliary stations off the bridge. that makes eight, plus the bridge makes nine, where are the other two?
[Chat] Josh Broderick: the weapons deck is a weapon room and so is the control room.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: thanks for helping to clarrify.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: anyone know where I can find a quantom drive upgrade?
[Chat] Josh Broderick: ah, found it.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: does anyone have a couple canisters of quantum fuel?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale roars in anger
[Chat] Philip Williamson: yes?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Fucking rats.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Bit me and now I feel sick. Dammit.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I wish we could add more drone bay extensions. I don't feel like spending hours reseating drones, I'd just like to add an additional drone bay extension to the four already on this ship to hold my anti-rat nesters.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: Hello.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: putting a factory near my moon was probably the best thing I did in a long time.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: How convenient.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Seems semsible.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: where do i get the mining patches?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: so if my mining drones fail?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Ahh. You can install a debris refiner on your ship's cargo bay and use six pieces of debris to make one at a time. or craft them on factories.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: how many rooms do you generally need for your industrial plant?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Just so you know, Zinjorg, Central Carstairs will be selling these mining drone patches momentarily.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Thank you, Gladr.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: So when i launch the mining drone, do i wait?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: you may. or you may move onto another planetoid and launch another if you have more than one in your ship. that is their advantage.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: their has to be a faster way to move this stuff.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: what stuff?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: the minerals I just baught, my ship can't take it all i one load, and I have to unload one bay at a time into my factory. it's slow and tedius.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: buy a cargo tank and unload them into there.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: yeah, cargo tanks are awesome for that.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: it's much faster though it involves you purchasing a new ship as well.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I keep forgetting I have one of those!
[Chat] Yaslene Webster chuckles softly.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: Yaslene!
[Chat] Josh Broderick: just dump the cargo tank in a hangar and transfer from its CONTROL ROOM.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: can I link a tank to my one ship that I just puta load of these minerals in? or does it have to be lnked ot the tugship to transfer minerals.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: you have to use the tugship to move the tank around.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Don't feel bad. I can't use a tug ship either.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: which I personally think is a little blahish but hey, what can ya do.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Never learned.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: you have to dock the ship you bought the minerals in and enter the tank. from there, use the computer and UNLOAD. Wait until that's done, then repeat if you need to.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Well, I suppose it makes sense. Remember that some cargo tanks can hold more minerals of one kind than 20 cargo bays put together.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: but when I get my tank to say where I want it to go, meaning back to where my other ship can I thenk connect it to my starliner to offload?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: I think so?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: there we go. Central Carstairs is selling mining drone patches for those in need.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: how do you get the water from barrels of liquid to transfer into the reserves for an industrial plant's charge?
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Empty them into your ship's cargo bay first.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: ah.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: is their a way to increase your factories tanks past 30000?
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Nope. But you can build another refinery.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: So... does anyone ever have trouble catching up with and chasing comets? I used to be able to do it, but something's off that I can't quite touch. I try to catch up to it with warp, chase it, match its speed, but I'm never near enough.
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits through a half laugh:  All right. I'll figure it out, then.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Try to increase the speed and then slow it down, although I am not really sure, never chased any.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Have done. Will keep trying. Thanks.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: anyone know what the communications array does for industrial plants?
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: It's for comm range in deep space.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: ah, and the rifting abilities? Is that built in?
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: It's built in.
[Chat] Josh Broderick: nice!
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: greetings pilots. Looks like there's not much stargate and I would agree with, given their short sited approaches to ship construction. Maybe this in the fact they own most of the upgrade shops on small remote worlds is contributing to the problems pilots like myself are facing.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: a long time ago, there used to be a structure...
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: it was a planet stil, though a shipyard style station like solar blade has, that'd be more beneficial. I'm going to see if I can get a meeting with one of their execs, to see if we can work out a proffitable arrangement for galactic citizens.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: if you want it michael, you can have it.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: that dude has recieved 20 quad from me of alte.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: ahem, late.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: wait who?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: oh wait, no he hasn't.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: mm, no, I think. thank you so much btw.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol a whistling sound can be heard before a loud explosion deafens the radio with an annoyed yowl in the background:  Why does this simulation actually hurt?
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits over the sound of tapping keys:  Careful there.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: as you can see, moon industrial work is quite proffitable.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: yeah, it is.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i can see, and plan to begin that work soon.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: dear me.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: wow, thats more money than I paid for my wolf.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Wow. That's a lot!
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: yeah, that's really a lot.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: my harvesting gear is stuck what to do?
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: repair it.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I tried.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Adjust it.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Up, or down.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Shift it rather.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I tried that too.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Well, then try it until it will be centered.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: sometimes it is not aligned and sometimes like now it is stuck.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: you have to stop harvesting then adjust it.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and we're four, and think all human in membership.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: miscom.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: not harvesting.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: okay this is getting seious.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: serious.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: calm down. Don't panic. It's alright.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: but it will erupt before long.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: Just stop harvesting and ... get out of there.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: more then that... only members left after all the inactives being stricken from the rolls left myself, you and Jason til Vladimir joined.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: okay am landed and safe.

[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i'm not entirely sure.
[Chat] Jim Green designation chuckles
[Chat] Trip Sinclair: you can build wherever, an information computer should be able to tell you where the forests are that you can go to for lumber.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: the manual has a restriction I don't really understand.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: How does one plot a course with universal coordinates... if possible?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: amu in a direction, or plot with galactic coords in a sector and use quantum drive to cross boundaries.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: how can I know how to shift my harvesting gears, up or down?
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: It'll tell you.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: nope.
[Chat] Susan Guttenburg: Yep, I tried it yesterday.

[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille laughs
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: this food shopping network is deceptive.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: menu sounds like the food is much cheaper than what you actually end up paying.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: there is a delivery fee.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh that.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: if I had known that I would have just gotten direstions and walked.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: which the fee's cost is dependent on where you happen to be as well.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: and I can't talk right.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I miss the days when you could order food from interesting locations. Deep space dining?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: heading off comms for a bit, rescuing from stars.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ah nice.
[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: i need coffee!

[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: damn, that was close.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Is someone about who could make me a rift generator?
[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: probably.
[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: not me though, my paws are no good with nuts and bolts.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: but great for cheese.
[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: well, that's a given sir. cheese is my expertee. currently.
[Chat] Nathan Tobin: i hate walking around at night. As i don't have an info computer or anything of the sort, i think it would be necessary to buy one. plus i won't be able to see where i'm going.
[Chat] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: definitely would recommend investing in one.
[Chat] Nathan Tobin: i could use a light right now, or some way to become able to see in the dark...
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: What should I do? I don't want to lead missions, because i can't lead heavy stuff yet.
[Chat] David Brooks: You can try doing the smaller ones at this time.
[Chat] David Brooks in a thoughtfull voice:  You could go after some gas from nebulas Zinjorg. Heard that pays ok for for what it is worth at your rank.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: the instruments sound amazing they will increase my scientific knowledge of sound.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: I shall buy one emediately.
[Chat] Nathan Tobin: Damn, how the heck am i gonna get past rank 1 or whichever rank i'm at without a starship to salvage with?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: hand mining, sir.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: or ask someone to take you on some missions.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Or hunting, if you want.
[Chat] David Brooks: Hand mining is a vary usefull activity. Trust me.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I have a few instruments myself. I have a cello, a trumpet, a harp, a grand piano and a harpsichord.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: I will buy the trombone because it is portable but has a very resounding sound!
[Chat] David Brooks: That is a good choice if I do say so myself.
[Chat] David Brooks: Has anyone done any starship rescuing? If so, what kind of luck have you had?
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: nope.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: not here.
[Chat] David Brooks: Is it because of the distances envalved?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: it's because i'm not the right rank.
[Chat] David Brooks: I see.
[Chat] Lydia Gray designation in a chitter: I just never tried. looks interesting though.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: don't you have to be like 1800 or something?
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: if it is anything like Malulial extraction, I fear that by the time I got to the malulial, it was gone.
[Chat] David Brooks: I think it would be at rank 1400.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: way out of my league just yet then.
[Chat] Lydia Gray designation in a chitter: oh. well then not even near the right rank here.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: nor me.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: I'm only rank 301.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: though i am now rank 317, pretty cool.
[Chat] Lydia Gray designation in a chitter: only 58 here. so, yeah.
[Chat] David Brooks chuckling:  Sounds like that some pilots need to go after some of those nebulas.
[Chat] David Brooks: ANd others need to well, go after, some dust and the like.
[Chat] David Brooks sings:  What a life, a life, a life, life of, life of, a pilot.

[Chat] David Brooks: chat Hmmmm?
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: ahh the great bacon how we eat the in great crunches.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: we pilots need much bacon. at lest those of us who eat the stuff.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: yes I how ever can not join you in this pleasure.
[Chat] David Brooks sings quiently.
[Chat] David Brooks: Oops, was I transmitting?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: we can't chop down trees at Mulrala can we?
[Chat] David Brooks: is it just me or was a ship smuggling?

[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: good evening everyone. I am very proud to announce that I have completed an intensive field medicine program and am now officially certified to practise field medicine. This was an area I was sorely lacking before, so I felt it necessary to address it to better serve.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: congratulations.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: It is good news for me.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: And for MI.

[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation chuckles
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: amazing. Olivia just pointed out to me that it has been just one day more since she and I graduated from the academy.

[Chat] A brown horse named Jacob in a snort: Just woke up. Otherwise can't complain.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: ah, cash.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: well, and raise my rank to, but that comes as standard really.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: I could say I agree, but money is one of those things constantly on the mind.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: unfortunately, it's the way of the galaxy.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: you need money to survive.
[Chat] A brown horse named Jacob in a snort: I agree.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn makes a hmm noise of agreement
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i'm hoping to make a killing from this, though.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: at least, when i'm done, anyhow.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: now I'm debating a very difficult delema. I am core harvesting at the moment. so question. I woder if I should transfer it for credits and experience or keep it to construct things? I just don't know.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: wonder, I mean.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: I would use it on factories. those minerals are quite nice.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: agreed. though I soarly need the rank. I have a goal in mind.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: you'd be much better off transfering the gas and core chunks.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: alright. I'll go ahead and keep the minerals then.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: that is more what I wanted to do anywy.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: bid war.
[Chat] Syuri Dark green scale in a growl: heheheh.

[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hmm.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Top that, biiiiiitch. hahaahjhahaha.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias no like sound of war.
[Chat] Syuri Dark green scale in a growl: any bid war is a good bid war.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: just jokin.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: right....
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: please do top it.

[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: The military controls too much.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: They're just doing their job. heh.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale transmits a long pause.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: that's true, the government in general basically has a monopoly on technology, them, and their few friends.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: What would we do without them, eh?
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: as a high ranking member of the military, I do have to admit thjat the patrols on mission central is a bit, much, and unnerving.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: so I do most certainly understand your feelings on the matter.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: things like obfuscation tech would make sense to provide to as many as possible, to increase survivability during invasions, but it is limited to military personelle. Weapons I get, you don't want to give out the most powerful weapons, but shielding and protection, that's different.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: baking cookies for my open house is fun.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Some of the weapons being controlled is fine.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: ahhh, was that something you picked up during your enslavement time? I apologize if that sounds inappropriate.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: I actually do not want everyone to have planetary cannons.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: ... weapons.....
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias not like talk about weapons.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: But everything that manufactures things is some kind of government shop.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What mean open house, sister Ehpus?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: maybe meet party would be a better name.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: meat aprty? so you're going to have cuts of beef and other animals there?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: I am thinking of inviting whoever wants to come see my new house tomorrow evening and to meet me and maybe at that time find someone willing to adopt me.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: sure.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: so baking cookies for a snack.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation transmits a long pause.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: baking, you say?
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: yep and got the recipe memorized which helps a lot.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias not good at make food.

[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: oh I love baking and it makes my kitchen smell awesome.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Ehpus former family must taught Ehpus well.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: In human speech.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: he's saying his family tought him well.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: don't criticize him for the way he talks. I'm human, and I have no trouble understanding him thank you verry much.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: james law man not understand.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: I do believe he was actually impressed with his level of speaking, mister donivan, not criticizing it.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: yes, to believe Tobias was.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Thanks Ulysses.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: wish all  all had, such good family.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: ah.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias and Jerore grow same family.
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: and it might also be worth mentioning that it might behest you to not jump down their throats sir, as it may trigger a traumatic event from their time in captivity.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Thanks Ulysses. Bad larkan trigger memory...
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What mean jump down throat?
[Chat] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: an angry way of confronting or addressing someone.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: not appreciate insult of jerres brother.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I was not attempting to jump down anyone's throat.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I need some advice, please. I jumped from a clan to Mars. Mars was out of range. Now I am trying to set the coordinates, but the ship is not behaving correctly when I try to move it into warp.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Try scannin again, miss.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Just scan Mars, and click the "course last" button. Your course will be set correctly.
[Chat] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: Remember, planets move, so sometimes, if you rift to it, you will end up just one unit away from where the planet is now. so just scan the planet again and move to it and land.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Thank you. I hope I can sort this out.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: you are welcome.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Hey every person.

[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: I am well thank you. and yourself?
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Well, I almost enter fields without any weapons on this ship. That's gotta tell ya somthin.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: I'm not sure if what that tells me is what you mean to tell.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: What does it tell you?
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: ah yes. I must admit I've done that before as well one time or another.
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux in a husky creole accent: That you're rather absent-minded.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: You're...Uhh...Yeah that could be the truth sometimes...
[Chat] JAG liaison Soshah Devereaux chuckles
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: considering he has been saying he is going clothes shopping for the apst several days, I believe it.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Oh right! Clothes!
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I'll get to that.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Eventually.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn sighing:  oh boy.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Drew, when were we doing that one thing again? You never gave me a date.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: and you didn't give me a date!
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I have MI training and I don't know when it's over.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: hmmmm, what to do?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: hmm.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: this is that point when I don't have enough anti rat dronesto do this properly.

[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: give more options?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: jerre not know.

[Chat] Moran Midnight black designation in an angry chitter: Hello there.

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: well, guess I can't unload this crate of recourses I just got. just tried to do so twice. once in my cargo bay and once in a factory that I have access too. both times the screen on the crate flashed a message that say I can't do that here, or that I have nothing to unload. guess these plastics will have to go back on the market.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: You can try public storage at Permian Industries, if it will help you.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: thanks. I'll give that a go.

[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Hey... does anyone know if it's possible to transfer amunition or fuel or anything between ships?
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: hey andrea. they go well. how goes things.
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: caralee!
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: chief general, it's good to hear your voice.
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits with more enthusiasm than she's shown all day:  Kayla!
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: things go quite well for me, Kayla. Thanks. Glad to hear you're doing well. Also to hear your voice.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Caralee, I sent you a link request.
[Chat] Caralee Watson coughs, then,:  Beg pardon. Chief General!
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I am glad you are well, Chief General.
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: thank you, attorney. I have been rather busy of late, but I do try to say hello here from time to time.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Ah, here we go again.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Is it possible to outfit any ship with the necessary equipment to haul cargo tanks, or must a separate ship be purchased for that?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I wonder if I have the space at Penumbra to store all that.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: miscom.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Are we allowed to harvest asteroids, then bring them in, or must we only haul those we have not touched?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: are there any JAG people around? There's a pauagiwa i'd like to addopt.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: gotta file a case in the conference room on Star Command first.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: rules and regulations you know.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Does the person who I am addopting also have to file a case?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: no, just you... as far as I'm aware.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: okay.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Ugh, what just pushed me over.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: definitely wasn't me.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: un... what the?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: someone's gonna have fun with the debris once the snafu in 26 is cleared up... my stars at the debris.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: any bomb reloading centers anywhere other than maraquda?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: not know.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What mean vacus tossing toys?
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne sounding amused:  I wonder if THE JAG would ever seriously consider a case of me suing the vacus.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I think you should. honestly.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hmm, it will nice.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I just wish there were ways for civilian pilots to engage when sectors are invaded without needing exhorbitant amounts of turtle drones that frankly, usually aren't available. There's not a worse feeling out there than watching your home get attacked and not being able to defend it.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan well, the vacus are basically public enemy number 1. Let's see. *sounds of tapping on a datapad* Sorry general, I don't think we'd be able to, getting them to show for the trial is part of the problem, you'd best handle your case with those SDL battleships and superior tech you guys have.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I agree.
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: damnit.
[Chat] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: was worth a try.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale rumbles a chuckle
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: anyone seen harmonia's senator?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: while I will say that thepatroll ships are useful in situations like this, Ido feel that they took away a lot of the kills. I like blowing enemy ships up. a lot. but then I can't really be pissed at the sdl for trying to protect our space, especially since I hope to one day serve within its ranks.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: in other words, you let the patrols do most if not all the work.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I would rather not eat them. I find the idea repulsive. Yet my ship's lounge keeps overing me burgers made from their meat.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: we tried to get a crew.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I just wish that the SDL would allow at least some of the purely defensive tech like obfuscation to filter to civilian pilots. maybe on a license program, like with mines.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Suggest it?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: what.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: the obf thing.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I plan to, that's one reason i'm hunting down my senator. The others involve corporate matters.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: mail could you tehm?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I guess I'll have to.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: seems lady dianne Sholtz doesn't have a mailing address on the infonet. I can't find her information anywhere.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: strange that is.
[Chat] Senator Dianne Sholtz clears her throat before transmitting:  Hello?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: strange indeed, strange indeed.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: hello.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hello there.
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: hello, M'am.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: senator, I wish to schedule a meeting to discuss a few matters.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: if I may comment on the lackluster response for crew for a moment... Granted, it was my first time trying to crew for such a thing, but I fully expected more pilots to respond to such a threat within our space, not just 2 or 3 pilots.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I agree with denny.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I apologize for being so far away.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: You thought space was bad? I would of had to go it alone if it weren't for the Chief General participating.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it's ok, we got a few licks in, but I do think ythe delay cost us a few kills. No biggie, I'm still learning the ropes of commanding a crew.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I know that, Vaz... that's why I commented 2 or 3 pilots is embarrassing.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I hope I can be far more available, as my warp training improves, and I have more clearance to travel faster through space.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: personally, I'm more disappointed than embarrassed.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: what happened? Nothing's in the news.
[Chat] Senator Dianne Sholtz in a clear crisp accent: yes dear, I am thinking of holding a meeting amongst our origin city.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: we had an invasion, Mr. Waters.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I was mortified at how slowly I could travel through space.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it will improve with rank.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: gravjump is a thing.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Oh damn. How bad? Probably slept right rhough it.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: as are the teleportation facilities. that's what I used.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i slept through it too, on my bridge no less.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i take power naps on pride of zordon, then again, i had just finished running missions.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I had an asteroid, and I forgot about gravjump...
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Oh my, how did that come out to the press?
[Chat] SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent: I do apologize for not helping with combat, though, to be honest, I'm a healer, not a killer, by nature. I can gun, I can fight, though I'd much prefer to heal the injured and help the sick. I'm sorry if that makes me less than a pilot to some of you, but that's how I live my life and I won't change that.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I am glad there were not too many vacus this time.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: andrea, I do not call you less of a pilot. you were trained for a specific thing.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Were a lot of sectors hit?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl look I know everyone has things going on, but if that had been worse, er let me rephrase that... intense, it would have turned quite messy extremely fast. I guess I'm kvetching over here as even I made some mistakes that could have ended it faster. *sighs*.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: estrana and mission central. estrana was getting pounded right in the face.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: For some odd reason, I'm now picturing a baby Vacus smacking a baby Chief General across the room due to that news report.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: as am I. and it does not give me comfort.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: And in the background of that image, their pet Dulfarite trying to devour a certain cat whole.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I'd expect 6 to be hammered, as we all now by now Mission Central is a vulnearable location.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: So, we just need to find Vacus General, and do something bad with him, with her, or with that. I do not know what it is.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Lance Corporal, that is skipping a few thousand steps, and assuming the Vacus will be fully affected by one death of leadership.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: well, then I hope this won't come across the wrong way, but it is probably good that I am taking my vacation now. Heading hope to Oriali for a couple weeks to stay with the rents.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I'll just end it by saying that I absolutely, positively do not want a repeat of what happened to Upgrade Mania... that still hurts deep down, most of you know what I mean. For those who don't... ask a more seasoned pilot.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: ladies and gentlemen, if you believe that civilians should have access to military obfuscation technology on a license program for the purpose of better defending local space, please sign my new petition on business central. I accidently messed up the setup, so it's in the accessories for your business shop.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Well, I'll see you guys in a couple weeks. Time to catch my electro-rail.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: that's train, for you non-oriali types. heh.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: good luck.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Thanks.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: be careful out there.
[Chat] Quentin Waters in a smooth Orialian baritone: Nothing on Oriali is as dangerous as being a pilot. But Have a good one everyone.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I will.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: My cargo bay is damaged. I need to get it repaired. Is there any way to have the materials sent to me?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux meows
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux in a soft mew: Hello.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Awesome, another one of us.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: hi.
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux in a soft mew: There can never be enough cats.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: we need some dogs to even it out a bit, however.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: oh hello joyeux, vazbol.
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux in a soft mew: Hello.
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux meows
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: yes joy?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: yes vazbol?
[Chat] A cute little tabby named Joyeux in a soft mew: Oh nothing.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: I just felt like meowing.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Meow to you too!
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale cannot meow
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: how are those claws, vazbol?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Still sharp after clawing my way out of a Dulferite's jaws.
[Chat] Denny Chandler meows
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: any spare chips?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale roars at all of the cats
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: I'm still looking for a weapon one.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Way too rare. You can have this teleport one for starts though.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: thanks.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: oh that's great!
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: You would still need the oxygen upgrade to make full use of it though.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, and weapon.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: you're searching the larger enemies, right?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: see, I do a convincing meow.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: I uh, I'm testing the weapon one for something. Outside of that, a rifle would do fine, but I was told these weapon chips give less kickback when firing heavy weapons.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Yeah, tried for warships and the like.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: However, these Dulferites eat through armors fast on direct hits. Taking a break for the day.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: so, it appears that.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: once a factory you own is set to private access, you are not able to teleport to it, despite being the primary owner.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: who's bloody well idea was this.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Yes, it is so.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: That does seem quite the oversight.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: If there's no power, the teleport pad will not function, most likely.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Perhaps the teleportation pad, as it has no power, is not safe for you to appear on?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I said nothing about power, I'm refering to if the factory is set to private.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: In that case, then it is a foolish oversight, in my oppinion.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: If you own it, you should be able to teleport there as long as all equipment is functioning correctly, I would think.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: ehpus think so too.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: you'd think.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: You are locked out of your factory now?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I suppose I can get my other ship, but I shouldn't have to, that's my point.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I agree with you.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Though, at this point, it may be your best option.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: I agree as well.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Teleporters should be equipped with access codes for private facilities.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: does anyone know the range of anti-rat drones?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: good job, jerore.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: thank friend!
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hope advert be on tv.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: garry, sure like tv...
[Chat] Jerore Sonders giggles
[Chat] Philip Williamson: can someone send me something for poison, quick!
[Chat] Philip Williamson: anyone got chunks or bricks I could aquire? I can put my factory on public.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: man i wish this pirate would just fuck off already.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I think, I just bit off a lot more than I could chew.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: How's that?
[Chat] Austin Blake: I launched an attack against a moon, and it failed, from what I'm gathering.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Hello trouble.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: I've done that before. Just hope they don't take offense.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Who trouble?
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Austin is trouble.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Now what bothers me is the damned clay.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: Takes too long to get from a pit and i have to go back at least once every half hour or so.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: where can ehpus find wax?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: not know, does jerre.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: ehpus not find nests in mulrala.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Hey. Is there a list of industrial plants out there that are riftable as a point of getting into deep space and back, by chance?
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: sure.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Can you tell me where I might find it, please?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: I hope i hear back from the JAG about my case.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Where do I go to arrange a meeting with the Queen on Navu?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: for what purpose if I may ask?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: because I want to adopt a Pauagiwa, but it's a little bit more complicated since I am a dragon.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: what I would recommend is that you mail her. Bare in mind that it's also complicated since the jag do not handle dragon law. Whether the jag even handle dragon adoption I don't know.
[Chat] Ehpus Out of Komarova in a grinding rumble: maybe ehpus and zinjorg be good friend and another adopt.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: what's going on in the galaxy today? I just woke up.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: dang, turtle drone sales are once again pitiful. We need a way to bulk order them in advance.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: that and anti-rat.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: at least for those, there's more than 3 stores to shop in.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: could someone send me a vehicle recharging battery? I ran out of charge right before I was able to land and I'm stuck.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: that battery will increase your ammount of charge capacity. if you can't tug to a landing pad, someone can send you an energy chip. i would if i still had a delivery drone.
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: blast. No I can't tug from here unfortunately.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: what's your location?
[Chat] Katrin Green designation in a chitter: disregard. I forgot I had some in my backpack.
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits in a pensive tone:  Do deluxe modules for mineral gathering stack? As in, if two are installed, will the ship gather minerals faster, or will the ship refuse to install over another module like that?
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hey folks.
[Chat] Austin Blake: Hey folks.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I love what I am seeing at some of the farms near mine. I love the creativity. It is inspiring.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and is it me, or do some pilots think it's ok to be rude to newer pilots? Just saying... noticed more of that going on lately.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Some are quite rude in any field.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg transmits in a tired bubble, "Huh? What have I missed?"
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I did not find a place where I could buy chicken feed. Grass is not a problem, it is the grain and other items I am not certain how to find. Do I buy custom-ordered seeds for grain?
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: no, you can usually buy them right there on your farm, and they'll be delivered for you. Rather expensive, grain.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Most interesting. All right.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I guess I'm saying if you don't know an answer to a newer pilot's question, just say you don't know instead of giving a dismissive answer. Common courtesy, I suppose.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: I tend to keep about four hundred thousand units of grain on my ranch at any given time.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Thank you very much, ma'am.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: That sound like lot of grain.
[Chat] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg in a bubbling voice: you are most welcome. If you should need any further assistence, I am about for a while yet.
[Chat] Martin Eerey12135 in a drone: I did think that you grew it. I was incorrect. I am entirely sorry for seeming dismissive...
[Chat] Martin Eerey12135 in a drone: I have dishonored you, human. I am deeply remorseful.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson snickers
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: It is all right. I did not take your words as offensive, though there are rude people out there. You are fine.
[Chat] Martin Eerey12135 in a drone: though the human did, peach one.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: and my comment wasn't specific, it was a general comment, more of an observation.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What Martin and dragon talk about?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: It is true. There are rude people everywhere.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias try not be rude. Tobias try nice.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: You are nice, Tobias.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Thanks... how pronounce name? Firaliana?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Yes, but you can call me Fira, if that is easier.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I just listened back to the recorded history on my comm and saw the comment you made about rude pilots, denny. I know it was generalized, but I can tell you right now that if there's someone I don't particularly like, I won't be rude (at least I'll try not to be.) I will, however, be rather short with them. I'm also someone who appreciates bluntness and honesty, but I have a problem of being too blunt sometimes. If you want something without sugar coating, you're gonna get just that. If you're feelings get hurt, sorry. but you asked for it straight. That's what you're getting from me. No frills or strings attached.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What mean sugar coat?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: it's just another way of saying to soften the truth so that someones feelings don't get hurt.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Oh my. That is expensive.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Thanks Jason.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I may need some temporary assistance.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: no problem, tobias.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: hmm?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: ugh, I hate when people sugar coat something... it makes me think they're hiding something...
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: some call being blunt rude. I call it being real.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I purchased the amount of food recommended, and it was six trillion. I now have one trillion remaining. I did not realize.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: The pigs have food, but the chickens do not.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: as do I, denny. If you're gonna tell me something, don't beat around the bush. spit it out. give it to me straight and unadorned..
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: What Firaliana need help with?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Credits .. I am ashamed, truthfully.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Aand now how to get water here.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: How much?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I may be all right now ...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: well if you ever want to make more money, I can hire you on as an interior decorater.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I pay, extremely generously.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: What is it you're decorating?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I am going to be constructing a huse, a very large one.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: pardon me, a house.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: You are a busy one!
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Caralee, i've sent you a link request.
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits in a bewildered tone:  I... don't know you...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: right, I don't accept requests from completely strangers either.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: neither do I.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I've tried that technique, but gotten flack over it... but the minute you annoy me, there goes the link.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: If I've chatted with someone over this channel and we seem to get on, I may, but... without even that... it's just odd. I'm... not quite that extroverted.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: don't blame you...
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Understandable.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I just don't like people, that is all.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: except for me.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: Completely understandable. I understand.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: the only time I insist on a link is from my clan members, but that's more of a managerial thing.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I will get links usually without too much reservation, but I only speak regularly with a few people.
[Chat] Austin Blake: I'll link with you, but, if you demonstrate yourself to be an ass, or you abuse the link, I'm under no obligation to keep it.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Likewise.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: essentially what I said earlier.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: I'd have a link with anyone, but if you will be unkind, there goes the link, meaning there won't be one.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: How do I purchase plant food? I feel quite foolish asking this!
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I only see animal feed on the market.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: the only thing that bugs me about the way links are set up is that it also reveals your location... I wish those two parts could be decoupled so I can say who knows where I am at any given time. Anyone agree?
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: You'll want to take your tractor and plow your land there.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: that, can be abused so fast.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: bother jerre it does not link location.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: having someone pop up where you are with no warning.
[Chat] Caralee Watson pauses, then,:  Hmmm. I probably would if I cared, but I'm usually in private places or my earpiece is off if I don't want to be bothered...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: time to check up on my crops.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: I also tend to purge links if I don't talk to the person after linking, so... I haven't recently because it's been my fault I've been away for so long. I.... had a bit of a calamity occur at home I had to take over a year to begin sorting out. But... for the most part...
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: sorry, let me clarify... we should have the right to approve or deny our location been seen by those we have a link with.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: I'll agree with that.

[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: um... what happened?
[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: its a burning vehicle. not sure how it started though.
[Chat] Trista Vinova in a sharp temreth accent: Would it be bad to say that this helps clear out Terra's landing areas?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: oh...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: someone might've crashed.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: uh oh, didn't know vehicles are that dangerous...

[Chat] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: thanks also to zinjorg of the green scales for helping as well. for some reason my fire extinguisher was malfunctioning.

[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I could see one reason why it's not a good idea to have a factory too close to a planet... what if there was an accident and the factory explodes... safety issue I think.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: sorry folks, extra taxes may migatite such a scenario, considering the potential costs a planet would have to repair any damage done in such a scenario, remote as it may be.
[Chat] Denny Chandler coughs:  er, mitigate I meant.

[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I know many disagree with me, but I think taxes should be raised a bit in that circumstance... Why? Think of would would happen to a planet if a factory explodes. I know it's a remote chance, but there needs to be funds available to deal with such a scenario...
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: this not affect me. not have factory.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: you do make a good point...
[Chat] Caralee Watson transmits hesitantly:  Well... doesn't most every sector have a planet in it? Unless they want the planetless sectors to be entirely congested...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: move it into uncharted. problem solved.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: I was thinking that. it's an idea.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: I may do that...
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: well, I will assume since too close was mentioned, there's probably a point in space far enough out that shouldn't cause an issue.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Can someone pick up Tobias? Not able get taxi from business central.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: but still within a sector with planets. they have to be reasonable about it...

[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Only if you win the art contest!
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: rules?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: And then your ship could be pauagiwa specific.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: ooo.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: rules?
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: The station is called Fireheart Industries, so something that is related to that in some way, with a short explanation of how it relates. I'll pick the three I like the most and save the others for rotation in various parts of the station. They'll all have a sign or plaque near them saying who the artist is so everybody gets credit.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: You can only win first, second, or third. No claiming more than one prize.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: hm...
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: And of course, visitors are free to enter Fireheart to look around. It is still unfinished at this time, but you can get an idea of the atmosphere.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble Fireheart must be a hot place... *laughs*.
[Chat] Dealan Silver scale in a growl: Only when Tyranaz finds the temperature controls for his lab accidentally wired into stationwide life support...That was not a fun day. A horrible prank only made worse.

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: that works too.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: or Danimara.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: maybe it's because I can look some dragons or Ryuchi in the eye while most humans would have to look up.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: definitely Danimara.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I love harmonia for that long straightaway from the center of the village.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Or you can use this desert on Sahariana.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Sahariana hot though.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: you're in a vehicle, what do you mean it's hot?
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Oh... Tobias not know person be in vehicle... Tobias feel stupid now.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: thank the stars for automatic climate controls.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: got the air cranked.
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: GOod eveniing.
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: good evening.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hello.
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: How's everyone?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Good. You?
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: Doing great. Thank you.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Darn it. I can't allign this damn vehicle.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: aline.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm debating giving up on finding dark matter to park my industrial plant near and just finishing up these nebula's and exiting this field and parking my industrial plant.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Does anyone know where a larkin shower is?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: On Calira, maybe.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: on calira, definitely!
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Or you can use one on Permian INdustries.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Industries, sorry.
[Chat] Maelitta Winter39672 in a drone: Oh. another question. How do I aline my volcano harvester? it's driving me to currupt my systems.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Just shift harvesting equipment up or down.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: For example, if your equipment goes down, shift it up.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: so my industrial plant is deployed, not near dark matter, but hey, their it is. I'm emptying debris cansters in 80K loads into my plant. I wish their was a faster way to do this!
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I think water is batter fuel for plant.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yes, not too fast, but use water, 80000 so one full shipload, that'll give you 30 days or so.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I suck at comit chasing. so I can't get comit water, sadly.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: For example, 80,000 debris give you 6 days of charging, while 80,000 liters of water are almost 28 days.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: also, if you want to be close to dark matter, you should've just rifted to a plant far out, and gone a sector away and established. Dark matter is 150 sectors out, so hard to come by.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'll come back, it's ok. I wish I could get comit water, but I suck at comit chacing.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: You can just use barrels of liquid.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: oh, how?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: no need, just load liquid from your factory, but do it 4000 at a time, dump it in your favorite cargo hauler, 1 bay at a time. it's a good bit of work, but you only need to do it once a month.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Just unload it in your cargo bays and transfer to your plant/.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: so don't dump the barrels into the tanks, just dump them into your bay and fly.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, yup.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: time for water! my factory has a crap ton!
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'll just grab 200000 and go dump them off! and some bricks and some metal panels.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: you can't dump from the trolley into storage? you have to dump the barrels into a cargo bay?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Yes.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: And insert it in your water tanks.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: ok, sorry, this is a learning experience for me, I do sincerely appreciate everyone's assistance. I had water in one of my cargo bay's wonder why it didn't take it?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: because I was inserting barrels of liquid as I found them in cargo barrels, so I'm surprised if you have to insert the barrels, why it didn't take what was in my water cargo.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: the water facility section of the manual specifically mentions comit water.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: screw that manual, that bit ain't accurate.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: trust me, barrels work.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: james game again?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: trust me, i've been running plants that way for almost a year.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: sure.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: can I reach out privately, James?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: nope, I just watched my charge go through the roof!
[Chat] Philip Williamson: cool! we get MI patrols?
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Hey everyone.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hello.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: How's it goin?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Not bad. How with you?
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Not bad. Need to go do some paperwork I think.
[Chat] SDL Star Admiral Brandon Red designation in a deep commanding chitter: yay paperwork.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Right, to Maraquda I go.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale laughs:  paper work is over rated.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: it will bury you alive.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Man I feel it, but it's gotta be done, ya know?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: o, hello there Eletherian. Long time.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: hence the keeping it from doing just that.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: hey there. Corperal Jitel.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: sorry, Lance corperal.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: How are you doing?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: awww. no bricks on the market. sad.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: standardly standard yourself?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: what market?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: that thing that says it's the market. that really isn't.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: I'm doing well, I just finished work with these ship drawings.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: oh yeh, that thing. no surprises then why there are no bricks on it.
[Chat] Eletherian Sapphire blue scale in a growl: awesome.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Hm, maybe not paperwork. Let's see if I can buy this upgrade!
[Chat] Hugo Black scale in a growl: i go on a lot of hours to grap creating some bricks is shall putting them on the market.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm debating what other rooms to add to this plant.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: It's pretty quiet this morning.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, it is.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm just working on my industrial plant.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Oh James. Hey. You get my mail?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, totally did.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Awesome man. I really do appreciate it.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: no problem, I'm always happy to help pilots in need.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: How'd you do that, by the way?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: one legionaire and one stralenite, both with nice sized docking bays. i expeled it and transfered it to my stralenite at my factory, and flew it back to harmonia. easier, as i don't like to land my legionaire when i don't have to.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: tug lines are the best.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I can't wait to get nicer ships. So jealous.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: Have you ever had a chance to see Pride Of Zordon? She's a real beauty.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I fought on her but never really got the chance to look around.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: well, i basically live on her, so I'm partial to her as any captain would be.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I can certainly imagine.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: hi.
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Hello Hello.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: hello there.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Hey how ya doin?
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: I am fine. HOw are you?
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Searching for this office I need.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: well hunter, i've decorated Pride of Zordon up nicely, so her living areas are quite relaxing.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: She sounds like a beauty to own. Having something like that...I can't really picture it for myself.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: well hunter, i see you're on maraquda. Why don't I pick you up and help you imagine what it could be like?
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Gotta find this damn registration office first, but then sure.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: you have an idea where it is?
[Chat] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: It is in new moscow, i think.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Not a clue. And the mapper isn't being helpful none.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: how do i land on earth i can't orbit it or grvitate to it.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: plan to it, then land on it.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: how do i get to the citizen registration place on danimara.
[Chat] David Brooks: Who all is watching this?
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Me...
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i'm there.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm watching. I couldn't make it in person.
[Chat] David Brooks: I see you there.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: watching what?
[Chat] David Brooks: the TV.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Tobias there.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: No. I really don't watch tv.
[Chat] David Brooks: This can not end good.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: where can i buy things to kill rats.
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: diana.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: thanks.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Use an info computer or holo pad or some other device to look for the things you will need. Also, read the manuals which contain basic information to get you started.
[Chat] David Brooks: At least the dragons are willing.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I missed the start of this, who's representing the human in this? those of us that wish them to be freed?
[Chat] David Brooks: Not to sure. But I wish for them to be freed.
[Chat] David Brooks: I heard one dragon speak up, or at least when it comes to adopting.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: what is a rat anti-nester and do i need drones in every room of my ship or just the cargo bays.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: They kill ratika ships from outside your ship. They are installed into your drone bay.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: there is a book, Rotten Ratika, that you can buy. It explains all this and more.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: You need defensive drones, not anti-rat nesters, in each room of your ship. Also, go to Temreth and get some emergency drones as well.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: i have got defensive drones and also guard drones too.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: the best way to get defensive drones, sprays and the like, use the outfit function from a vermin shop while your ship's on that planet.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: guard drones are bought seperately.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: will that put them all in.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: do i need to fill my ship up with the chemical as well.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: yes.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: there should be portable televisions.
[Chat] David Brooks: Why not mount one in your ship?
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: I already have it works great!
[Chat] David Brooks: I am watching this in my factory.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: I am watching in my living room.
[Chat] David Brooks: Ugggg... From what I see here, things are worse than I thought. Why do people wish to in slave live beings in the first place?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: is easier, t han working for selves.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: those who slave live beings are so unkind.
[Chat] David Brooks: Agreed there.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Well, that was interesting.
[Chat] David Brooks: No kidding.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Why jet take long time on airport?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: you have to go to the runway.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: because jet old and slow!
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i don't know, but i just used a vehicle, i'm already back in my office complex on Zordon, Zordon Towers.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Oh, my apologies.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: gorngon, emilee, you left your patient. I'll drive her over, where do you want to meet?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: well, uh.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: she just got left behind?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn after a long sigh:  apparently.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: caelum, i'm sorry, i thought you were taking care of her, so yeah, come to caelum, dock with bay alpha., i'll have a stalf waiting for her.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: She was standing?
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: she got off the bed and left.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: so i thought it was out of my hands.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: The injured woman got left? I am sorry.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: wise word, just because you're walking, doesn't make you healthy.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I thought she left. I saw her stand.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: yup.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: A moment. I will go back.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: sec.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: It's already taken care of.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: I'm hanging out at dockside dive on Avalon if anyone wants to join me.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: The beer and wine is good here, and food too.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: gorngon. hun, dear... what is the name of your facility?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: Caelum, that's his.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: ah, thank you.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh, it's a nice place.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: where is this.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: my starbase in 13.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: yeh that.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: 1 for cult??
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: ah yes, i forgot i'd put a coder there har.
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: hehe.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: are we gathering at this star base for trinks and relaxation?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: we are not. this is a medical emergency, we're waiting on hunter to put on pants.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Basically.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: oh well then I will help if possible!
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: need me to get you guys?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: no, thank you.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: you will help him put on pants?
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: what the.
[Chat] Diego Garibay131600 in a drone: ahh yes!
[Chat] Drew Halithorn giggles
[Chat] Gorngon Orange designation in a chitter: no with the injered.
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: james?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol emits a growling yawn over coms
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: hello there.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: Heya Sir.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Hello Vazbol.
[Chat] David Brooks: Is there any tv channel that shows any mission type stuff?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: think news does.
[Chat] Nelson Orange scale in a growl: Hi all, how's everyone this morning?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: thinking of earlier meeting...
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes, it was quite bad was it not?
[Chat] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: heh.
[Chat] Bryan Maxwell: Hello all.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Hello, sir.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: Hello human.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent Vazbol is so nice. *giggles*.
[Chat] Bryan Maxwell: He is also, technically correct.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol meows
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: hmmm, what to do.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: The heck? I thought I saw metal panels on the market, but I saw no one buy them, yet i do not see them.
[Chat] Bryan Maxwell: Sadly, I can see it's going to be a lonely night for me. So, I do think sleep is in order. Industriousness will come to me later on, I'm sure.
[Chat] Adam Smith: I was wondering if someone could help me with a ship problem. i seem to be trapped in my docking bay.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: how is everyone tonight?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yikes! what ship are you in and where?
[Chat] Adam Smith: a tug ship floating above sector 10 beacon.
[Chat] Adam Smith: I just need someone to dock and recycle my airlock.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: ah, okay. i think i see your ship. looks like you don't have public docking enabled. what's the issue? can't get inside? i'm going to attempt beaming aboard.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: recycle?
[Chat] Adam Smith: thank you so much.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: should be a cycle button in the control room.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: if he's in a tugship, which he is, he's separated from his control room by his airlock, poor design if you ask me.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: There are a couple people with you, sir. In future, it is best to ask over this channel, not missions, for help. I hope they can get you out of your ship safely. If you need anything and I can assist, let me know.
[Chat] Adam Smith: thank you. sorry for the misscomm.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: You are fine, sir.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: got you.
[Chat] Adam Smith: ah thank you who ever did that for me.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: feel free to launch at any time.
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: Hi everyone.
[Chat] Adam Smith: thank you so much for your help. I really appriciate that.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: hello.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: and adam, no problem.
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: How is everyone?
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: hey.
[Chat] Melody Lawson in an American accent: I am well. just feeding the kids. how are you?
[Chat] Galina Rose designation in a chitter: Doing great. thank you.
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: refine micro drones?
[Chat] Zinjorg Green scale in a growl: misscom.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Would it be possible to have some plasma cannon fittings constructed, please?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: of course.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: For myself as well, please? I can pay.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I need to do a few batches for my ships anyway.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Which factory do you own?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: zordon.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Very well. Please let me know when construction is completed.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: Has anyone done meteor chasing, and if so, was it enjoyable?
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Do plasma scoops allow you to recharge ship plasma in space, or are they for some other purpose?
[Chat] Adam Smith: you champion. i've only got def drones at the moment.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: hisotory.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: there's other branches of that shop, but I forget where off the top of my head... maybe after I have some coffee.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: personally, if you're flying your ship there, getting the drones and stuff on mulrala is easier.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: i am just worried.
[Chat] Denny Chandler snickers:  So even the vaunted JAG has it's share of racists, eh?
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: how so?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: they been accused of that for the longest time. In the history of the jag, there has never been anyone who wasn't a human.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: just scanning the headlines while drink my coffee.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: i wish these rats would stop killing me.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: not much of a multy race organisation, then?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: none at all.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: this either should change or the jag should not have the right to make and enforce laws from the other races.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: has anyone from one of the races attempted to join the JAG and gotten rebuffed? If so, that just lays the truth bare...
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: when I use to run the jag, no one from any other race even attempted to join.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: no applications, in fact, no other race even shown any interest in joining.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i wonder why?
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: was their any underlying readons?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: well sure, they were too busy applying for the military orgs.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: there may have been, but they've been intimidated into not doing so...
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I'm sorry, but I've learned to be skeptical of government actions simply by experience since I've gotten my piloting license.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I don't think it has anything to do with intimidation, they're just not interested.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i don't get why so many wanted to join the milaterry. milaterry force is only good with laws to keep them in check.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: one word, tech.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: milaterry force is only good with laws to keep them in check. Otherwise, it all becomes about personal power and self acomplishment.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: you said it, the military has superior tech, not to mention, virtually a license to do quite a many things.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I'll be honest, if I didn't love the law for what it is, I'd be military too. that is quite literally why not as many folks want to join the jag.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: so nothing what so ever to do with racism.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: I even contemplated joining the SDL several times, and had submited an application before I was rehired at JAG.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: I don't know what I want. but i'll see.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: joining the jag would be, benefishal i believe, to quel these rumers of racism.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: and support a multy race law organisation.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: it would goa long way.
[Chat] David Brooks: So, hello...
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Hello, David.
[Chat] David Brooks: So how is everyone?
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: oh, well enough.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: Quite content at this moment.
[Chat] David Brooks: Good good.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: uh, how do I stop the trolley from taking away my water? stop trol seem to be not working.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: you can always move it to another room. that's an easy way.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: it'll just say it picked up 0 and stop.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: aha, make sense.
[Chat] Tobias Guttenburg: thanks.
[Chat] David Brooks: Finally someone got fired over their coments.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: who.
[Chat] David Brooks: It is in the news. You have not checked.
[Chat] David Brooks: And alan is dead.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: but what comments did he make.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: he was a scientist.
[Chat] David Brooks: A Paralegal got fired for a racest comment and alan was found dead in his lab.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I don't think the two have anything to do with each other pal.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: unless alan was a closet lawyer.
[Chat] David Brooks: Woke up to those things in the headlines this morning.
[Chat] David Brooks: Other then that, I see no link either.
[Chat] Kevin Sisco149645 in a drone: hello.
[Chat] David Brooks: And a big hello to you.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: someone remind me to get more warp crystals at some point.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale in a growl: go get more warp crystals.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: thanks.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i didn't mean right now.
[Chat] David Brooks chuckling: Ok, get more warp crystals now.
[Chat] SDL recruit Stormy White scale snorts:  now im out of warp fuel.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: anyone sell them at a cheaper price than maraquada? they are, taxed rather heavily.
[Chat] David Brooks: I think some factories sell them.
[Chat] David Brooks: At a higher price the last I checked though.
[Chat] Miah Thompson: Hello all.
[Chat] Tobias Hamilton in a grinding rumble: Hello.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in a soft Diannen cadence: greetings.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: anyone I can hang out with?
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: sure, i'm not doing a lot.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: sure.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: awesome, I'm at Central Carstairs.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i'll be there when things stop going pue pue.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: Starlight's Lounge.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: actually, let's try cafe navu. I like that one better.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: okay.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: awesome I'm there now. take your time.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: where we meeting up again? i forgot.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: navu!
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: wow, this cafe is amazing.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: would anyone know how many metal scraps it takes to make a metal panel? I'm trying to construct as many as I can for my new factory and have 3065370 scraps to work with.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: ten.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: okay.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: an unknown star that I couldn't do anything with, sad.
[Chat] David Brooks: How come?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: not sure, it was after a wholehole jump.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: wormhole.
[Chat] David Brooks: So far, I have been able to handle most stars that I see through wormholes.

[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: do you have guard drones?
[Chat] Vladimir Dalca in a mysterious tenor with thick Russian influences: do you not have guard drones?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: that's sad. do we know yet what killed him?

[Chat] David Brooks: Not to sure how that will help, but you need to felter in some gas to help I me thinks.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: i am just fed up cause i can't do anything.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Is anyone on earth that can assist. If not I can make my way there.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i can try.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: sorry to be a pain i don't want anyone to get hurt.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: be there shortly.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: thanks a lot i really do appreciate it.
[Chat] Casey Bradshore: i am in the medical centre.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: lydia, race you!
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: I told you I'm dropping off my son so a race is no fair.

[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: where's your ship.

[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: is anyone willing to put me 1000 liquid on to the markett/.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'd rather sell it directly, after I watched the price structure.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: well sure we can certainly arange that, sir.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: feel free to mail me with a price offer for it.
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: i wouldn't even know where to start, given i've never actually bought anything from the resource market before,
[Chat] Jim Green designation in a chitter: hmm.
[Chat] David Brooks: I wonder how high this will go.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: it'd be interesting to see, fred's out though.
[Chat] David Brooks: Who has that much just to throw at it?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: many people, actually.
[Chat] Philip Williamson apparently just me today. *laugh*.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: I didn't even think it was possible to make so much... I'm always scrambling.
[Chat] David Brooks: It takes me just a bit to get a quod.
[Chat] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Wow.
[Chat] David Brooks: To be more correct, it takes me a few hours to get that much.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: nope, not here.
[Chat] David Brooks: With todays debris prices, 80 tril is what I would get for delivering a load from my ship.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: hmm, 10 ships worth would be 800 tril.
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: much better than what debris goes for on that farce they call a resource market.
[Chat] David Brooks: I do not know how long that would last though.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: well, it'd last until stormy runs out of money, so quite a whilek.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: while.
[Chat] David Brooks: Yes, he has alot of cash. When I say alot, I mean alot.
[Chat] David Brooks: He could, prett much, buy what ever he wishes.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, so it'd take a decent amount of work, but a quad a day isn't unreasonable.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: sorry, who has debris for what pricing?
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: just caught the last end of that convo.
[Chat] David Brooks: SOme debris auctioned off for a quod.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: and we were talking about stormy never running out of money like, never.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Is there someone around that could help Casey out here with some gas to get rid of the ratika heavily infested in her ship? I'm afraid I need to take a short rest after running back and forth trying to help get them dead.

[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i should really start on a factory at some point.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yes. yes you should.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i know but.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: resource gathering, at this rank, is not easy.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: as for the regular ammunition boxes, they are a way to purchase rounds for hand weapons, 50 cal bullets, mini rockets, stuff like that.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Dammit. I was going to buy those, Phillip.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: I'm sorry, I kinda needed those!
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: As do I. I am in the midst of building my factory, and I cannot proceed without them.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i am about to start building my factory.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: where on business central?
[Chat] Philip Williamson: let me finish what I'm doing up here. and I'll chuck you 5K metal panels, that should get you started.

[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: only pinnacle.
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: What?
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: for those of you interested in reviewing and maybe signing the petition to grant pauagiwa slaves the same rights given to all members of the allied races and protections under the law. In essence protecting them from cruelties like beatings, and unjustified murders, you can find it on business central, conference room 1.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: roger that, ma'am. i'll give that a look as soon as I can.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I will deffinantly sign.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: I will go there when I'm done here!
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: as will I.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: As will I.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: I'll sign in just a sec.
[Chat] Nathaniel Yellow designation in a chitter: i may do that right now, infact.
[Chat] Adam Smith: I'm strugling to find vackus to kill today. none in this field.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: Screw the ship, visit your local Sola Vertus Invictus.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: as apposed to your long distance one.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: Personally blast vacus in the face with a weapon of choice.
[Chat] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: uh, aposed.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: mmm. blasting vacus would be fun if I had some decent armor. I have none, however.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: damn it I can't get back to my industrial plant.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: done signing.
[Chat] Emilee Hamilton: come join us, Oro.
[Chat] Oro Ocean blue designation in a chitter: on my way.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: so I went into a field near my industrial plant, before I went in, I logged the coords as 2,461.0, 2,149.0, 449.0." I came out of the field, and thinking I'd be clever I set those coords as my course and warped back to it, but no industrial plant. What did I break? Apparently I need to learn how to fly out here better.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: I just singed the petition myself.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: as soon as I get back into locals, I'll sign it. I've realy gotten lost out here.
[Chat] Courtney Mayes in a soft irish lilt: petition?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep growl: Ah yes, the thing of the modern age that standard predators cannot overcome is the standard lock.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: for now.
[Chat] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: hahahahaha.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: What the hell? Jason, wow?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: well, you can't blame him, it's cheap as hell, and he's building a factory.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: right?
[Chat] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: He is not the only one.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: the prices are so dag gum low and artificial, and you're surprised when the stocks get bought out?
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: heck, those minerals up there are usually child's play for me anyway.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: He's not the only one in the midst of factory construction. I try to keep that in mind. That's why when ruby was on the market, I bought some, but left some for others as well.
[Chat] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: folks, it is important you transport your ship from mission central when not using it. With this blockade up, you can't even teleport down to transport them yourself.
[Chat] JAG Attorney James Donivan: the only other way is to go to another planet, and teleport over to mission hq. or you can do what i do, leave my big ship in orbit, and shuttle down with a shuttlecraft.
[Chat] Miah Thompson: Hello all.

[Chat] Lydia Paxton giggles:  "I was saying hello to everyone."
[Chat] Philip Williamson: let's see, just for fun what I'll get for a building delivery in thi smassive ship.
[Chat] Philip Williamson: christ, I understand fighting for what's right, but the latest news, absolutely not how this should be done. meaning the van.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: no kidding. I was prertty ticked off when I read the headlines.

[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: No one was active over coms?
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Oh no. Julia.. Is she okay?
[Chat] Drew Halithorn yawning:  nope. were they supposed to be?

[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: hmm I'll have to think about other entertainment things too.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Must not comment.
[Chat] Hunter Trask: I... Hm. Take that to links, I'm thinkin.
[Chat] Tannin Azure blue scale in a growl: Where are comets generally located? Are they out past all of the planetoids and nebula fields?
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: There's a button on your console labeled comets, I believe, which will give you the locations of every comet in locals.
[Chat] Ada Hopper in a British-American accent: But it doesn't look like there are any at the moment.
[Chat] Drew Halithorn in an amused tone:  can some one get hunter a new shirt?

[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: oh, I'm still pissed tthat trash drone got the proof of the Pauagiwa being shot... I do hope they're recovering well.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Are you all planning another rally over there? Will I be needed to vommit into the wounds during the aftermath again?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Heard talks of going again, but that bullet spray may of injured peope even more.
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I suggest we do it elsewhere... that was quite scary.

[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Isn't it a bit useless elsewhere?
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: And stop being babies. You have medics standing by, and if things do get bad.

[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I'm not doing a protest on Maraquda, not without some backup.
[Chat] David Brooks: I recorded what I could.
[Chat] Nelson Orange scale in a growl: I agree, I don't feel like being blone to bits.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Babies. I don't like getting blown up either, but when duty calls.
[Chat] David Brooks: Need away to protect the proof while getting blown to bits.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Well, it's more like shot, stabbed, perferated with a cannon, electricuted, uh what else.
[Chat] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: some of aren't exactly military members, Corporal.
[Chat] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: drenched in poison, clawed, strangled with tentacles, hit with a missile.
[Chat] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Every day pauagiwa are getting beat or shot. I was proud to stand with citizens, pauagiwa and pilots alike to protest. Was it risky? yes, but so needed. I hope next time we have a larger show of support from pilots than we had last time.
[Chat] David Brooks: Anything they can think up.
[Chat] David Brooks: Why do you think I put up the videos for?
[Chat] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: I don't mind protesting in the least, I just think we need a bit better coordination.
