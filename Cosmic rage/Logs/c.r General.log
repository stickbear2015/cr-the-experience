[General] SDL private Calpurnia Malik in a sharp Danimara cadence: Ricky shimmering blue designation?
[General] SDL private Calpurnia Malik in a sharp Danimara cadence: I would like to offer a reminder to all pilots that to leave a starship unattended in space is a risk to your property, and to any life forms aboard. Not only could it become damaged, but starships take up space, and are valuable tools. It happens on a daily basis, and I have witnessed several lost to enemy fire, even solar flares. Please be mindful, and keep your property out of space if you can help it.
[General] Ricky Shimmering blue designation in a chitter: yes?
[General] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Studying in four, all.

[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: A small white mouse named Camille!
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: yes sir?
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: smuggling?
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: really?
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: beg pardon?
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: apparently, you have been caught smuggling.
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: this is unacceptable.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: but, i never, could it be the ship i bought at auction was carrying illegal goods?
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: bull.
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: nice.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: When did you buy it, and do you have records for it?
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Though not sure if that's possible. That or someone's highly lazy on the auction check-up crew.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: pardon me maam but i don't think i deserve that tone, what ever happened to innocent until proven guilty? i bought the ship recently, i purchased it over a couple of days ago. it's original name was crunchy goods, i just changed it now, which should have been recorded on the message board.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: i never smuggled. i merely collected my ship from mars, flew it back home and depositted it in my apartment's garage.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: you can come and inspect it for yourselves.
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: ok. not sure how the auction crew overlooked the smuggled goods.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: Do you know who you bought it from?
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: no idea sir. it was just listed on omega station. i hasve no idea if there was even a way to find out who it belonged to previously.
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: OK. I recommend that you do not take any action with this ship until further notice.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: alright sir.
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Can I see any of the Ship Building Facility Omega 8 management?
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: i was given no indication by flight control or earth landing, or any of the SDL ships i presume where in orbit that i was carrying anything suspicious. as far as i was concerned, the shp was empty besides myself and my cargo drone, which came from another ship i purchased at auction. now i wish i'd checked the cargo bay more thoroughly.
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: anyway, it will be better for you not to touch this ship until the solution of this problem.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: or Uh, to get a new one not currently infested with smuggled goods.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: alright. should i transport it back out on to earth's top of the rock landing pad? i'm not sure i feel safe sleeping with it not too far from my bedroom.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: but but but, this one is fully upgraded!
[General] David Brooks: how many times does jitel have to say do not mess with the ship?
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Stay in place, I'm on my way.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: yes sir.
[General] Frederick Barnes131439 in a drone: any ship can be fully upgraded ... but when a particular ship has a problem associated with it, it is best to leave it be, until the issue has been sorted.
[General] A small white mouse named Camille in a muted squeak: true enough.
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: Ok, please ignore the Smuggling message. if this follows.
[General] Philip Williamson: could I get ratika clearing assistance?
[General] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: alright. Come to Central Carstairs. I will meet you there.
[General] Philip Williamson: I'm on earth. trying ot get to medical, with broken leg.
[General] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: alright. I'll be there. does your ship have any ratika fighting gear?
[General] Philip Williamson: it was supposed to but using the defense drones told me it couldn't do anything. so it's horribly screwed. I'd have used fosgeen but I couldn't do that, either.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: do you have guard drones?
[General] Philip Williamson: I do but I can't get on my ship long enough to clear it.
[General] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: do they kill you immediately?
[General] Philip Williamson: yes I try and move and squish.
[General] Philip Williamson: I don't know how to fix it.
[General] Philip Williamson: I do have some with me but I can't get in to deploy and use them.
[General] Philip Williamson: "error! A drone in the specified location, Cargo Grid 2A, is unavailable!"
[General] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: what is the name of your ship?
[General] Philip Williamson: exploring the stars.
[General] Gladr Gold scale in a deep melodic thrum: alright. coming aboard.
[General] Philip Williamson: please except my link so we can keep this channel clear.
[General] Caralee Watson in a silvery, Oxford-inflected tone: Studying in four.
[General] SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders in a crisp british accent: how unfortunate. I will need some help to put out the fire, eh?
[General] Frederick Barnes131439 in a drone: you can request a firetruck to come and help perhaps.
[General] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: someone have any idea what that was all about?
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: What was?
[General] A  lioness named Camille in a superior roar: unsure...
[General] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: quite a few patrol ships just went down in sector 22.
[General] Lydia Paxton in an exotic greek accent: Is anyone investigating?
[General] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: I have no idea.
[General] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: given there is no one around from the sdl, we are conducting our own investigation. Thank you for your attention in the matter.
[General] Philip Williamson: let us know if their's anything we can do.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: what's going on?
[General] MI Sergeant Major Ulysses Battleship gray designation in a chitter: we have reports of sdl patrols going down in sector 22. Reasoning, unknown at the moment.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: i'll get pride of zordon heading that way to see what's going on.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: 22 is under high amounts of stellar activity at the moment, that could be a contributor.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: yup, be advised orion's belt has been overdrawn, venturing near center sector for those without gravitational resistance equipment is not advised.
[General] Emilee Hamilton: stay safe out there, guys.
[General] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: But you would think SDL patrol ships would have mega heatshields. So I am thinking that's not what happened. But I could be very wrong.
[General] Jerore Sonders in a grinding rumble: shields no perfect.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: oh, that's concerning. Someone really messed up the star here.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: and heat and combat shields are quite different.
[General] Snapp Blue scale in a gentle growl: Yes. I am aware of this.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a superior roar: Still going to look around to see if there's anything else. That would be depressing if those ships were lost due to a lack of shielding.
[General] JAG Attorney James Donivan: gathering energy from vakari's star, be advised.
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: studying in war cluster omega.
[General] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: you might want to investigate that fire, MI dude.
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: where is the fire? I didn't hear anything on my coms.
[General] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: than listen carefully to chat.
[General] Hunter Trask: Well, this is different...is there a military member around or something?
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: what's going on? I am currently with a friend on a mission but we are almost finished.
[General] Hunter Trask: You should come to Research Complex... There's a...Well it's...We're talkin bodies over here.
[General] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation in a firm, authoritative chitter: shit! on it!
[General] MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale in a growl: So, what happened?
[General] SDL Private Akasha Blake in a sultry Russian accent: done.
[General] MI Corporal Vazbol in a soft mew: If anyone just had an incident at Goscro Krah, please make a link with me, or contact me.
