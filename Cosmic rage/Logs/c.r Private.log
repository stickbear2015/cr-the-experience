[A  lioness named Camille to you in a superior roar], fancy providing charity to a poor pilot with little resource of her own? i want to bring in some roids, but not being able to use warp is slowing my ass down
[You to A  lioness named Camille ], I'm about to go to Maraquda to snag a warp fuel tank, where are you right now, I'll come get you and I can just dock your ship in mine.
[A  lioness named Camille to you in a superior roar], currently hovering over beacon station kappa in sector 9
[You to A  lioness named Camille ], hover their, I"ll come get you first.
[You to A  lioness named Camille ], ok, dock with me. in my bay.
[A  lioness named Camille to you in a superior roar], roger
[You to Melody Lawson ], would I be able to trouble you to send me a set of guard drones? I'm happy to pay for them, but I'm in a field nested all to hell and don't want to come out until I clear this disaster.
[Melody Lawson to you in an American accent], sure let me just make some
[You to Melody Lawson ], you are a goddess!
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], more ranks about to be smashed. another rock is throwing itself upon my tender mercys.
[You to A tigress named Camille ], well done!
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I'm at the public access tube since i don't have access to the staff one.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], hop in the car
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], how are you going?
[You to Courtney Mayes ], where on this planet are you?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], at the lounge. my firebird is parked outside!
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], heya
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], i made it to rank 200, i had a look around polaris the other day. so we can get started on the decorating whenever
[You to A tigress named Camille ], I had to reset a scanner, and I hadn't heard from you, but I need to reauth you to a scanner that I broke!
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], no problem. i haven't seen you around the last couple of days, so guessed i must have missed you, let me grab some mineral upgrades for my cargo drone and we can head over
[You to A tigress named Camille ], OK, before I officially get you started, how fast do you think you can have it done? I've got someone on the table that can have it done in like 3 days.
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], well, as i said, i'm unsure how fast i can do this, i don't even know what sort of thing you want really, we've only discussed things briefly. if you're looking for it to be completed fast, probably best go with the other person if they've guaranteed completion in 3 days
[You to A tigress named Camille ], I'm still willing to pay you for your time, because you took the time to look around, when you could have been doing something else, let me process that now.
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], it's alright, i just toured the station and took a look, it took me all of a few minutes, the payment isn't necesary, honestly
[You to A tigress named Camille ], already processed, ma'am.
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], thanks, if you need any more help in the future, feel free to let me know
[You to A tigress named Camille ], I will. Actually, could you use the money I'm sending you and find a really good digital camera?
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], i guess, are they listed on the shopping network
[You to A tigress named Camille ], I believe so.
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], hey, i can only find one video camera, on harmonia, that the one you want?
[You to A tigress named Camille ], sure.
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], thanks. what camera would you like me to buy
[You to A tigress named Camille ], what are the options?
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], one sec
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], just the one, a video camera, sure there's different options for color and accessories but that's all my search shown up
[You to A tigress named Camille ], that'll work
[A tigress named Camille to you in a deep growl], i think i saw a security camera on my shopper
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Hello.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], hello, sir.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Can I ask you one question?
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], sure?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Do you have the resources to do this? Or will I need to do everything from mine?
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], what resources are required?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], If you do not mind, I will finish some things. Then I'll go to the industrial plant and I'll tell you.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], ok
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], OK. In fact, for refiners it takes 430,000 bricks.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], I can in fact provide bricks
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Nice.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Where will it be convenient for you to meet?
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], I'm unloading even more bricks right now, feel free to dock to my factory. It's still heavily under construction, so just dock and I'll come retrieve you.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], feel free to exit, I'm here
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I'm running out to get a couple more refineries for quantum fuel, the factory is in the middle of crushing moon chunks into bricks, can you keep an eye on that task, and when it's done, start up the task to cruch the planetoid chunks for me, darling?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], of course i can dear.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], thank you, mistress.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], how's it coming?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], it's...coming i guess? Just getting started on the dwelling lobby.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], thank you for finishing the crushing task, sexy.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], it looks like I only have 319000. can you make up the rest for now until I can get more bricks?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], I can make with my bricks, it's not problem for me.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], you may want to make doors for your public/private areas.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], we cann, do you have ve the access to do it?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], i uh...think so?
[You to Courtney Mayes ], then feel free to do what you want, darling.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], You are welcome, good luck to you.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], thank you.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], hey love? can you come to phoenix for a sec
[You to Courtney Mayes ], on my way
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I'm here
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], i'm in the drone facility at the moment...meet me in the control room?
[You to Courtney Mayes ], yes dear.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I'm here
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], don't mind my drone, she's slow.
[You to Zinjorg Green scale ], I found it!
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], you found what?
[You to Zinjorg Green scale ], the way out
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], I see. It shouldn't be a big ship, only two airlocks.
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], How are you?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], thank you dear
[You to Courtney Mayes ], for what, mistress Courtney?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], for the debris...and your mail.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I am to please, mistress Courtney. This submissive is yours.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], yes...you have done well. It was rather surprising to read your mail. I am glad to have found you. To call you mine.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I'd like to wear leather for you.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt with a firm edge to her irish lilt], purchase what you wish to wear.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I don't know where to aquire that sort of stuff, I'd.... would you design me an outfit?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], i would. yes.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], you... would?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], Of course.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], it just might take a while.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], why didn't you like me in the dress? Or would you rather me in a different dress in private.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], dresses are meant for ladies. You are not one of those.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], but you are one, and I'm yours, controlled by yours, and wearing dresses in private, reminds me of that, and it gives you enough acces to have my body wherever and whenever.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt with a firm edge to her irish lilt], Surely there must be other reminders.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], used to being dressed by my partner, carried around, made to wear dresses in private.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], the day you become a female is the day i see you wearing dresses. Am i clear? If i want you...there are ways that i can have you without dresses involved.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], then you don't want me?
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], Of course i do. Where are you?
[You to Courtney Mayes ], just in my new ship.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], come find me in the dragon's den.

[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], try moving your vehicle now.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], nope, valet. it's my starship.

[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], I need 8000 dark matter for 2 level of Upgrade, I'll probably get them later.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], if I knew how I'd do it, but I'm inexperienced with dark matter mining.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Do not worry. I will go for the matter either today or tomorrow. It depends on how it turns out.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], I appreciate all that your doing.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Thanks

[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], let me see what I can do.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], can you make the upgrade modules while I pull bricks?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], When I get dark matter, of course. If you can wait until tomorrow, it would be fine.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], that'll give me time for planetoids
[You to Emilee Hamilton ], wanna help me pop my ship's mission cherry?
[Emilee Hamilton to you ], Your ship has a cherry? That's... Interesting.
[You to Emilee Hamilton ], .laughs
[Emilee Hamilton to you ], Please do tell me how this works?

[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], nice
[You to Melody Lawson ], could you help me find the place to pick up an industrial plant frame, ma'am?
[You to Firaliana Peach scale ], I'll include a few missile boxes as well.
[Firaliana Peach scale to you in a growl], Thank you so very much.
[You to Firaliana Peach scale ], it failed, send it back when you get it
[Firaliana Peach scale to you in a growl], A new feature. Thank you.
[You to Firaliana Peach scale ], your welcome
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I hope your doing well.
[You to Jessabelle Lawson ], are yo uok?
[You to Jessabelle Lawson ], are you ok?
[Jessabelle Lawson to you in a grinding rumble], Jessabele still crying.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], can you send me a guuard drone?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Sorry, I do not have them. And I'm away from the store.
[You to Jessabelle Lawson ], have you been adopted, sweety?
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], check the news
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], I am know about news.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], your the only one that can get away with that, ma'am.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], working on more bricks for you. I don't know how to dark matter mine.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], I will do it.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], I should creat my own industrial plant i just..... don't have the needed stuff to do it. it looks complicated according to the manual.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Honestly, it's not as difficult as it seems. 80,000 liters of water will give you almost a month of charging, and assembling them is not so difficult. Even if you take into account the fact that my Industrial plant is a clan, I do most of the work to maintain it, and it does not seem so difficult to me.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], maybe once I get these parts from you and enough quantum fuel I might do one.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], I should have the bricks tonight. how is it oming on your end?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], it is good.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], do you have the stuff for the two upgrades?
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], collecting now.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], and the reconstruction of the solar cannon? I'lll have the bricks shortly.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], sure
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], i need to find a nebula field. Could you please give me coordinates to one?
[You to Zinjorg Green scale ], I'm waaaay out in deep space
[Zinjorg Green scale to you in a growl], oh. Sorry.
[You to Zinjorg Green scale ], it's ok.
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], what do you need?
[You to JAG Attorney James Donivan ], to many people are providing conflicting information. I have almost 100000 barrels of water hanging out on my trolley. Do I: a. Dump them all into one cargo bay and fuck off to my plant and transfer at the water facility? note: I don't think I have one on this plant yet. or 2. Dump them into the tanks in 80K chunks before transfering ot the water facility.
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], nope. i said earlier, load them 4000 at a time. you need to dump them in a cargo bay on a ship, and insert the barrels., do this in each of 20 bays, then take your ship to your plant. that's why 4000 at a time, as you've noticed, it takes a while to load a lot, and you can't dump a specific amount.
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], once loaded, head to your plant and transfer from a water coolant facility, you must have also built one of these. if not, take an industrial plant room expansion along and 500 metal panels. you'll be all set after that.
[You to JAG Attorney James Donivan ], weeeea!
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], watching poker?
[You to JAG Attorney James Donivan ], what rooms to I *need*. all of them?
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], eventually, yes. if you want to build all the products, you need all the rooms.
[You to JAG Attorney James Donivan ], I'm just debating how much I should build now. this thing's not smart enough to determine what I"ve built already it looks like.
[You to JAG Attorney James Donivan ], can you privatize an industrial plant? meaning not permit everyone to land on it?
[JAG Attorney James Donivan to you ], nope, it's not. and sadly, you can't passcode the landing strip, or i'd have done it with IFP.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Hello, do you still need Level 2 upgrade for a solar cannon?
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], yes, I do.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], and level one.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], You do not need level 1. You can immediately install 2 and everything will be fine.
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], Send it to you.
[You to MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale ], thanks
[MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale to you in a growl], You are welcome. Do not forget to save your ship after installation.
[You to Brad Pinkett ], do you have bricks or chunks? I could use either, if you wouldn't mind fumping off at my factory.
[Brad Pinkett to you ], um, I will need to split some moons I think.
[You to Brad Pinkett ], I can cruch moon chunks
[Brad Pinkett to you ], may I see your factory? what's it called?
[Brad Pinkett to you ], and, only 1 moon around? the hell is going on?
[You to Brad Pinkett ], polaris plaza. docking should be public, if not let me know and I'll fix it.
[Brad Pinkett to you ], what you up to?
[You to Brad Pinkett ], spliting asteroid.
[Brad Pinkett to you ], man, that is slow, let me grab a moon for you. how many bricks do you have? I need bricks as well, am thinking of getting a house.
[You to Brad Pinkett ], zero zero ero!
[Brad Pinkett to you ], ahh, let me split this moon for you.
[You to Tannin Azure blue scale ], I'll sort you out in a few minutes, let me get these roids cleaned up, and jump back in, I"m in deep space near my industrial plant.
[Tannin Azure blue scale to you in a growl], Sorry. I've just been trying to get panels for days. How in the hell do the purchases happen that fast?
[You to Tannin Azure blue scale ], people are just paying close attention.
[Courtney Mayes to you sounding sleepy], hey there.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], hi! I'm trying to get back into locals and failing miserably.
[Courtney Mayes to you sounding sleepy], oh?
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I went out of locals to my industrial plant and boke it coming back in.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], aha.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], trying ot restock my bricks.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], I can't remember, do I owe you money for the factory? I don't remember if you finished it, dera.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], i'll be doing it today.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], thank you, I love you. I'm sorry I'm lost out of locals. butI'm grabbing stuff as I go and hopefully I cna get back.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], it's a bad submissive being out here when your awake. I"m sorry.
[Courtney Mayes to you in a soft irish lilt], it's ok. ZYou get what you need.
[You to Courtney Mayes ], yes, ma'am. IF their's a resource problem when building, let me know. or feel free to bring resources, let me know what you use of your own, and I'll replenish them
[Tannin Azure blue scale to you in a growl], Were you ever able to make it home?
[You to Tannin Azure blue scale ], not yet, I got lost out here
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I'm running around, about to go out and collect resources, does your factory require any resources, ma'am?
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], you're more than welcome to stop by though
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], miss
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], it's ok, I'm sorry to have interrupted.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], you haven't. you're fine
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], my factory could always use more things.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I'll pop by and check what your lacking, ma'am. Again, This little boy apologizes for interrupting an ongoing conversation.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], I told you, you weren't
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], your factory needs to be recharged. I don't have the necessary access to recharge it, so I can't check resources, or drop anything off until it's power is restored.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], ugh. ok hold on
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], let me know when things are powered back up, ma'am.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], already done
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], it looks like your refinery is missing tanks.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], because I can't get the computer to rspond to my inquiry so I can see if you still need the upgrade to the tanks.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], hold on I'll check
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I'm in the mineral refinery but it looks like workers broke it during construction.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I need to determine if you have enough drones.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], I do
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], are you maxed out on reserves and available?
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], should be
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], might wanna check that. it's good to keep up with that.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], back in a second, I need to check on the task at the other factory I'm working with
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], you had a stack of unrefined debris so once that is done I'll get more for the factory and refine that.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], ok hold off for just a moment. I think the valcano one is messed up
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], volcano
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], bug the technicians!
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], can't yet. there's still a lot that isn't ready yet
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], work away! it says your a large factory already..
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], I am, but there's a lot of rooms that aren't decorated or described, and I just haven't got the time to do it
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], I've got too much other stuff to do, and the person who's supposed to be helping me isn't around, of course.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], put up an advertisement, se eif someone can help you out.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], I haven't really got the money to pay someone as much as they'd probably ask me for
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], that sucks...
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I'm headed out I'll pick stuff up for you.
[SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez to you in a sweet, melodic soprano with a light hispanic accent], thanks
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], I'll get stuff from deep space for you. because I cna get more.
[You to SDF chief medic Andrea Rimirez ], about to dump stuff at your factory
