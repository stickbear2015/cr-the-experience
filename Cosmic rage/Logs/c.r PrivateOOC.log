[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], heh. Can you get into the apartment?
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], yes.
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], weird.
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], you might have to upgrade him to owner, if she's made that choice of permenancy, they should split the rent.
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], can they? the place was purchased outright.
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], should be able to make him an owner, somehow, wherever you purchased it from.
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], let me see.
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], i don't think so though
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], nope.
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], ignore that
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], if you transport it, I wonder if it'll let you.
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], no vehicle found
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], is he authorized to the garage itself?
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], you shouldn't need to be. once you're authorised to the house you should be able to do everything. ask on newbie?
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], ok, back IC. here he comes. :D
[Courtney Mayes to you OOCly], okey.

[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], ignore that!
[You to Courtney Mayes OOCly], I oocly don't know how to make a frame. and she might want to get a little more physical with his body.

[You to Akasha Blake OOCly], oh, dear. I can attempt to reproduce, have you tried change the temperature of the rods?
[Akasha Blake to you OOCly], It will lock on to the neb, and then it will let me extract, and activate the rods, but it won't allow me to harvest with them.
[You to Akasha Blake OOCly], what error do you get?
[Akasha Blake to you OOCly], no error, it just does nothing.
[You to Akasha Blake OOCly], your doing n-l then extending all the rods, then activating them all? that's all you need to do.
[Akasha Blake to you OOCly], yes, and usually it will then harvest, but it does nothing
[You to Akasha Blake OOCly], strange! give it a break for a bit, I'm just picking up my stuff IC.

[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], so question. Will payment auto renew?
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], no, it's manual. that gives you the option to pick a different plan if you want to pick a longer one or revert to a free account.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], Cool. So to renew I'd just poke you?
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I do keep an eye on accounts that are on monthly and prod you at 14 and 7 days prior to renewal, and yes just prod.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], If you decide to renew early just le tme know and we'l take care of it.
[You to Akasha Blake OOCly], I wish I could fix it.

[Faylen Claris to you OOCly], rofl yeah
[You to Faylen Claris OOCly], I updated the database for monthly so the text file actually says the right thing, when I remember how I'll update my leasey text.
[Faylen Claris to you OOCly], hehehe nod
[Faylen Claris to you OOCly], no big deal. and thanks for letting us do this. I figured 30 a month would have been a bit much for a single household, plus we could have just had him dl stuff for me lol. This way it's just simpler, but we won't share with anyone else, promise.
[You to Faylen Claris OOCly], I've added a note, and noted the IP for you guys.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], before I go suggest it, is their a buffer for login and log out notifications?
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], There is. It's called Connection messages.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], yup, that does make sense. lol.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], I need to review buffer docs and see if you documented what each one is, lol.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], I did not. I should do that at some point.
[You to Snapp Blue scale suggests it OOCly], 
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], The only thing is, when you look at the buffer titles, it's kind of obvious what they are for.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], cover the stupid!
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], then you can just go, see buffers.txt in helpfiles, and people will shut their faces. I ran across connection messages but didn't parce it to what i was looking for.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], Ah.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], hmmm. You don't seem to have the TV show two and a half men.
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], I have seasons 1 through 4 mostly described if you'd like them.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], let me see if I can fix it, remember a lot of stuff is being reorganized. If we have a private dropbox, drop it on my head.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], yup we do. :D feel free to throw it in, I'll take care of getting it up and put an entry in the changelog, what genre of the ones listed would it go in?
[Snapp Blue scale to you OOCly], I think I broke our folder actually. I can create a new one. And, I'd put Two and a half men in comedy.
[You to Snapp Blue scale OOCly], go into your home directory, create an uploads directory, then inside upload, create television, then inside television put comedy, then put the show in their.
[You to Brad Pinkett OOCly], hi!
