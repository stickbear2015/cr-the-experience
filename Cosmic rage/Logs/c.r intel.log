[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: roger that.
[Intel] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I can assist with space, but not ground, as i have no armour, and no weapons except my breath and claws.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: Let it be known that the squishiest of the armed forces is going it alone.. or how it seems so far.

[Intel] Firaliana Peach scale in a growl: I am planetside. I have been. but I understand.
[Intel] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: well, the SDL ships seemed to beat us civilians to it.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: indeed...
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: Guessing space is clear. Ground clear for now.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: it is. for now.
[Intel] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: it was over in space before we got many shots off... the SDL had it under control it seems.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: yep.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: The ground patrols had the weaker groups handled. However, the high warriors had them overwhelmed.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: Might as well keep watch until 1 gmt.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: Well, it's 1:00 gmt, and no more bugs. Standing down before the Chief General goes mad.
[Intel] JAG Attorney James Donivan: has there been recent activity?
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: There was, but the SDL patrols and Mi patrols had them handled. Except a group of high warriors.
[Intel] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: so what actually happened.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: The patrols managed to do 99% of the work at space, and about 75% on ground.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: I got thrown around like a doll, vazbal killed a bunch of vacus, and the patrols cleared out space and ruined the civilians fun.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: So not a great showing for the Vacus this early morning.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: oh! and I got slapped around the face with a tentakle! the indignity of it.
[Intel] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Ouch. are you alright, general?
[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: Cheaf general, at least I got to crew with a good pilot. I don't care that I didn't get to kill a good number of vacus, though lord knows I want to. simply to be able to crew was enough.
[Intel] Denny Chandler in a deep, melodious sounding southern drawl: well, I hope those Vacus were ripped a new one, then deep fried for extra measure.
[Intel] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Sorry. cheif general.
[Intel] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: me tooooo.
[Intel] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: chief general went on ground? I'm sorry I missed it.
[Intel] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: Me too.
[Intel] Jason Hamilton in a warm, ritch bass with a slight hint of a southern drawl: also, I hope you recover soon, cheif general.
[Intel] Leneya Anderrson In a soft posh London Accent: I would have asked to crew with her.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: mhm, chief general went on ground, quite a few times..
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: It was on the ground actually.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne laughs
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: And again.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: And off a mountain once.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: and again.
[Intel] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: I'd still would've love to see it.
[Intel] SDL Chief General Kayla Maryanne in an imperious new york accent: hey, do you think this means I'm aerodynamic?
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: What, the vacus treating her like a volleyball? That did occur for 5 seconds.
[Intel] JAG Attorney James Donivan: grenades and tanks are there for a reason, i prefer incenerated vacus to fried, to be honest with you.
[Intel] MI Corporal Vazbol in a deep, smooth baritone: benefit of splitting the high warriors up, you are less likely to get smacked. Downside, there's a chance to be tossed around depending on how they are scattered.
[Intel] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: pfft, bring it I say.
