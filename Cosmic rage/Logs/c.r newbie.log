[Newbie] Austin Blake: Isn't there a way to change ownership of a helper drone remote to someone else?
[Newbie] A human named Mileta: I think you can just give it to them?
[Newbie] Austin Blake: No, if your not the owner of the remote, it won't accept commands from you.
[Newbie] Austin Blake: I'm thinking there's a way to do it, but, it might be a one shot deal after they're created.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: transfer-owner item to player
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i talk to people outside of my ship on the PA?
[Newbie] David Brooks: Oh that. /ship outside followed by your message.

[Newbie] Courtney Mayes: thanks.

[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I got the first coring upgrade, but I can't tell if I got the gear with the upgrade, if this is an IC question, I'm sorry.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Quentin Waters: type core cargo. if the command works, then you got the core gear with it.

[Newbie] Philip Williamson: core gear says no!
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i make debris containers for people to put debris in their factories?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: those are made from moon bases

[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Are the objects planetoid drones yank from blockages artifacts?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Or just trash items?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Silver: You can give those out to a researcher, so yeah they're like artifacts.
[Newbie] Methelius Black gold designation: how many bricks do you get per chunk
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: 4

[Newbie] Alex Blood red designation: i'm wearing a battle suit and i'm wondering how to see my coordinates in space
[Newbie] Harry Brooks152131: I have no idea, but one thing I can be sure of is that they work much like spacesuits do.
[Newbie] David Blue scale: is there a command to store all the wood I'm carrying in a hut for building?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Nope.
[Newbie] Marenne Capaletti: I see every channel in the settings of my earpiece except for the origins one. Is there some other way to turn it on?

[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: yes
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is their a way, to move anything in one ships cargo bay(s) to another one?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: not without transfering it to your factory then moving it onto the ship from there.

[Newbie] Elenhiia Shier: I*
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: which ones?
[Newbie] Elenhiia Shier: I really should know this, but I haven't been to Panaxes in aaaages
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: Oh those. Well, those are probably ic. Though if you needed to suggest an ooc thing, I am sure it could be frazed in such a way to make it ic.
[Newbie] Elenhiia Shier: I wrote about a bunch of stuff my char would most likely not know about, that's why I was wondering
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is their a way to empty the ammo from one ship and move it to another?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: don't think so.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: not even the trytanium slugs?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: what command creates bricks from chunks in your crushery in your factory? I'm having a brain moment
[Newbie] Methelius Black gold designation: mcrush
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Crush from just chunks, mcrush for moon chunks.
[Newbie] Methelius Black gold designation: no
[Newbie] Methelius Black gold designation: mcrush is to move in to storage bay
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: witch is what I want to do!
[Newbie] Methelius Black gold designation: yep
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: can holovid avatars repair defensive armour?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: no
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: then I seem to be missing the point of them? What exactly were they designed to do?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a way to see only activities appropriate for your level?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: No I think.
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: no, I think. but you might try to check ahelp list
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: if you type ahelp list, you can see them according to their level. arranged in numerical order
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: you can type ahelp list and it lists all the activities in order by level
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how the heck would I repair my cargo chamber?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: With metal panels, or on a planet.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how would i do it on a planet?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: You'd need a repair center.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is there any way to uninstall a computer avatar by chance? Or deactivate it at least?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: just install new and select option 1
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: All right. Thank you.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Will that revert the ship back to normal?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: The messages I mean?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: i think yes.

[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: not info computers or radios, I know that for sure. I am not sure what else though.
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: use <dronename> or use remote controler if you have it.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: radios on the drone channel only
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: and look spec commands for some items
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: they can use radios, but just on the drone channel
[Newbie] Grake Donoven: could you change how is the door message when it's opened and close?

[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: note the dash between the words :)
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Thanks!
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: how do I make armor frames for things like helmits? help is being unhelpful.
[Newbie] Nakon Nasaria: just finish your frame and specify what part you want it to protect
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: where do I make frames, sorry I should have been more specific.

[Newbie] Nakon Nasaria: yes
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: is there a way to send with a delivery drone and not needing to accept?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: no
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: if the drone has more than 20 things, the other person needs to accept.
[Newbie] SDL private Calpurnia Malik: send a smaller amount of items, maybe put everything into a container
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: the drone must contain less than ten items

[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: use rod
[Newbie] Jimmie Smith: sorry, nothing happened
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: shine light
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: if I dump a debris canister into a cargo bay will it be smart enough to jump dump the amount my bay can hold?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: yes
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I have an assist up that I need to cancel, but I can't because hosts haven't seen or responded to it yet. My ship won't move, says I'm already at the destination, even when I type speed 0 or warp 0.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I don't know what to do.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Hold on, I may have fixed it. Sorry guys.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: How do I get a vehicle from a landing pad to my ship's vehicle bay?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Link it with the ship and type return.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: When inside the vehicle, "x here" shows no link command. Does this have to be done outside of the vehicle?
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: you need do it inside the vehicle.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: When I type link <ship name> I just get one of those generic "what you typed isn't a command" messages.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I see.
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: just type link, next choose your ship and vehicle links to ship, next step, type return and your vehicle will go to vehicle bay in your ship if it has it.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: You have to type link by itself, without the name.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Interesting.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Thanks.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: start, maybe.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL recruit Stormy White scale: type start?
[Newbie] Normann Dans149603: i mean why i can't start it
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL recruit Stormy White scale: maybe out of chareg?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: recharge it
[Newbie] Normann Dans149603: "This is a military vehicle.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: then you're out of luck. you aren't military.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Perhaps you shouldn't do it at all because it is a military vehicle, and you are not a military?
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: how do I build a lift in a starship?
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: construct the lift and install it in necessary room in the ship

[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: pick them in any outside rooms
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Any outside room, just type pick. Make sure your biology skill is trained

[Newbie] Normann Dans149603: how jump in space
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: anyone know how to use the whole list of colors for things on the game like clothing and such on custom items you can build in factories?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: you can insert the %c in your item so that you can pick a color when buying the item
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: that works for clothing, but not modules
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: and then just leave the color line in the construction prompts blank I guess?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: for mods, you don't have to include a clolor, I believe. 
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: nice
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: why is it that i try to use a pod, and permission denied
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: where are you trying to get?
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: trying to head to the stables on Kaldara.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: It might be you're trying to get to a room that's in a different area of the planet than the one you're on.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Can you see it with your mapper?
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: I think it's just one of those special rooms you have to find on your own. Like obfuscation stores
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: yes, but i want to quickly pod there
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: .nods.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: You may not be able to, she's right.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: You'll have to walk I think. or get a vehicle and drive.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: no, i can find it with my mapper
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: do you have the gps patch for you mapper? It'll make moving around easier
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: no, i don't i have no money either
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: why can I not turn off my rod, when I look at it it sounds as if I should be able to turn it off and on
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: according to my lessons if you mention a button to press the command should be in all caps
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: this helps with some screen readers that accentuate the all caps
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: like press the SECTOR button
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: Taht's traditionally the way you indicate a command, yes, although keep in mind that's not always the case. Sometimes if someone's trying to get you to do things, they'll talk about buttons or controls or whatever and just leave it at that.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is definitely helpful with readers.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: this ship says I have 11 weapons rooms, but I only count 9, if you include the bridge, what am I missing?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: can someone remind me how I get my salvage container back?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is there a way to describe what the inside of a lift looks like?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Or to include ambient messages as it's descending?\
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Or ascending.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: you can describe the inside of lifts by typing describe once in it. you cannot change its ascending and descending messages
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thank you.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: no problem
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: oops I forgot
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is it possible to put decontamination chambers on factories?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: I do not believe so, but that's something you can suggest.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: is there a way to see what certain songs do?
[Newbie] Tobias Hamilton: I don't think so.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: I think the help paugiwa file discusses the beginning songs
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: it does not say what they do but for the one that is just to ammuse
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is there any way to clear a factory log?
[Newbie] Normann Dans149603: why npcs doesn't respond to there phrases
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: you need to direct your phrase to the person like so - olivia hello. it works the same for npc phrases
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: note the dash and space before olivia's name
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: how do you remove a biometric scanner?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: it's in the edit-f <direction> menu.

[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: why does switch-on rod not work when switch-off rod did?
[Newbie] Emilee Hamilton: try x rod. it'll show you commands and such that you can do with it.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: thanks for the reminder
[Newbie] Emilee Hamilton: No problem.
[Newbie] Madeline Olivier: how do we jump to places now, is that still the same?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: yes
[Newbie] Madeline Olivier: ok, because when I came into the sector... it gave me weird coordinates when i gravjumped
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: oh yes, planets now orbit
[Newbie] Madeline Olivier: ah ha
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: how do you change the way you walk?
[Newbie] Madeline Olivier: Ok, for like star command, how do you dock with it, if it's constantly moving
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: does it make sense for us to train hunting and related skills or is that different from combat?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: because I know hunting would be required for some crafting
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Ergh. What's the syntax for using movement? The syntax in the help file isn't working.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: move <place>
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Er, movement channel.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: since when do you have to pay for using the pods?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: For a month or so.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: planetary
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: When something's delivered to a factory, where does it actually go?

[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: I don't think it did.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: type exits.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I am in the truck
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: also, keep in mind that the combat system puts you into a grid in each rom.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: how am I to know how to get out then?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: right now I hate the grid system
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i get everything from a delivery drone?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I'm at the coordinants of alpha3 but it's not here
[Newbie] Aaron Cross: the tanks are just for MI members right?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Indeed they are
[Newbie] Aaron Cross: thanks a lot
[Newbie] Titus Pendragon131837: I wonder, how would a cy-larkan turn off their built-in translation system?
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: How do I alline my vehicle? vocano one?
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: volcano
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: How do i allign my volcano minor?

[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: railgun
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: LOL I should have tried that.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thanks.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: what commands permit salvaging ice from planetoids, or do I have to take a planetoid vehicle down for ice, etc.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: because my ship can hold it now, but I wasn't sure
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: you have to take the vehicle down.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: then trnasfer it to the ship after, I think.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i use the mining drones?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: you type dmd.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: okay. Thank you
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: and have some mining patches on hand to deploy so you can repair them remotely.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: where do i get those?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: you may ask that in character. :)
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: When drones load your ship with resource market purchases... where do they put it?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: in your cargo bays
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thank you!
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Has a change been made that requires jump confirmation / choosing of which satellite to use when rifting?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: yes
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Yes
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: yep
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: thanks guys.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: I would like to draw your attention to the @changes search <string> command. If you search for rift, you will see all changes containing that word.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thank you.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Sorry.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: no need to apologize, it is handy for all sorts of things :)
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i transfer the stuff from the mining drone?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: you need to send them into your cargo tank, then type unload <drone>
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I have a cunch of minerals I need to collect that I baught on the market, I want to put them in my mineral tank, I've slide it out of it's tug ship but collect doesn't show the tank!
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: You cannot put them into the tank
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: You need a ship with a cargo bay in it, then you can collect and they will be put in your ship's cargo bay.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I have plenty of those. lol. ok thanks for that.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is there any way to get an escalator from a room that no longer requires it? I'm still seeing mine here and the down exit's gone.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: I don't think, you'd have to assist to get it removed and to have the exit back.
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: ok, what's the command to transfer water to an industrial plant? transfer only does debris
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: I believe it should be done from the water facility, did you build it?
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: ah
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: is there any way to get my mining station back after I've lost a base?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: no
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: let alone my ship?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: nope
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: crap
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: what is considered a coordinate area?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: hunting areas, oceans, mning places, a few others
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: mining areas excuse me
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: oh I understand now
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: yep I got it
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i make a farmhouse? is it the same as building a hut?
[Newbie] Trip Sinclair: when building rooms in your apartment, what are valid exits, i know about compass directions, and upstairs downstairs, but are there any other directions? like if you wanted there to be an archway in the room's description, so the exit was go archway? or is the compass directions and upstairs downstairs all?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: That's all you can do I think.
[Newbie] Trip Sinclair: fairplay, just wanted to check
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: you can also do uphill downhill trapdoor and climb upand climb down and a few others
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: northup southup eastup westdown northdown southdown eastdown westdown climbup climbdown
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: climb up
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: and upstairs and downstairs.
[Newbie] Trip Sinclair: ah awesome
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: You can look at help exits and their short names to.
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: how do you view all your links again and not just online people?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: olinks
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Oh. All of them...
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: you have to set it in the options first.
[Newbie] Jessabelle Lawson: It can be changed in your options
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Right. What they said.
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: thanks all.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: how to emote on radio
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: okay I need help
[Newbie] A small white mouse named Camille: what's up
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I am following the help file and combined my first 2 chunks of wood and stored wood like it says then I did the hammer hut with hammer and got the message that it progressed but when I tried to hammer again it says it can't find it and when I type look all that is here is wood
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: actually it says there is a pile of logs here and I can't get it
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: you need to keep hammering it. It's name changes as it goes through the stages
[Newbie] A small white mouse named Camille: no, you can't pick them up, once you start, you just keep putting more logs in to the hut and keep hammering until you advance the design. fair warning, i cut down like 2000 trees for a small farmhouse, which only had three rooms
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: you need a total of 35 wood to get it to its top stage, methinks 
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so it uses all I have stored then with one hammering?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: only 5 wood from when you have stored. I think? 
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I had stored 11 wood chunks
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: you may need some more
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: right now it calls it a pile of logs
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: more wood required
[Newbie] A small white mouse named Camille: it changes from stage to stage, logs, a few sticks, a hut, a small farmhouse
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so store 5 chunks at a time?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: yep
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I wonder what happened to the extra or maybe I need to type hammer logs with hammer
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: that worked
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I will get this yet
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: thanks for the help it now says some kind of shelter
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a reason a factory would pay 680 billion when the message I get before transferring debris says they pay 1 billion per piece, and I know for a fact I had 800 pieces in my hold?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: maybe the factory ran out of money?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Possible.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: how do you add clay from your moon truck to moonbase storage?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Just put it on building place
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: if you leave a moon while citizens are building, does it freeze up?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: no
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: well, i think i'll have to assist then, because it looks like that's what happened to me just now.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Oops. Er, so if you save something to a video computer, it uploads for everyone to see? I thought it was just a backup. Any way to delete something from there?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: assist, maybe?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: if it's offensive or overly inapropriate, it will be removed upon request.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: It's not. It's just ... not really all that interesting and kind of stupid I guess so seems weird to post it publically.
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: quick question, is it possible to actually scroll back flight control history?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: it is history map
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: apologies, it is view map
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so I got the message my hut is complete but when I type build to build a new room it says the area is not big enough to build another room?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: if you want to build more rooms, advance it further
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: like I did for building it? storing wood and hammering?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: yep 
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: the hut is complete, but you can now turn it into a cabin and farmhouse
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: yay fun not over, thanks
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: why does it suddenly start saying I feel a little foolish when I type chop axe?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: is there a way to see how many unused wood chunks you have stored?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so can you not build further than a farmhouse?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: think that is as big as you can get
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: okay
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I wish you could redescribe the outside
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I don't like the default desc
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: you can definitely put in a suggestion, but please keep comments off newbie. Feel free to join ooc, though
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: how often, say, when you set a moon base task for 30 times, do the citizens perform the task? is it once an hour?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Every hour citizens will drop near the base canister with debris, or sack of minerals, depending on the type of task.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: thanks.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: You are welcome.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: so I'm curious. I saw some fireworks in the shopping thing on my info computer. How can my char construct these?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: your char cannot. they are bought only.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: ah, okay.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: when you recipe bowl does that make the ingredients disappear you put in it?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: okay what am I doing wrong, I tried making cookies but can't find them anywhere?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: can someone help me with this cooking and baking thing please? I have tried twice now to make cookies but can't find them
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: and I can find no help file on it
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: when you say you can't find them, what do you mean
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Does anyone else have trouble transfering minerals to a factory by chance? I put in the relevant information but the bay never seems to diminish.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: check your refinery tanks, they might be full.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thanks!!!!
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: to confirm the recipe command on the bowl, does that mean we can make recipes not in the game?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: yep
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: fun
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is this a known bug, where planning to a place drops you outside its landing range? This keeps happening, and I feel like either I'm doing something wrong, or there's a bug here.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: that is not a bug.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: i think it's the planet moving.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: When I scan planet, select my options, then type course last, warp 2 says the ship slows dramatically. It shouldn't be moving. Speed 40 doesn't move it either. I'm, quite literally, stuck.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: try land again.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: That worked. I am so confused.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: can I break up asteroids for bricks like I can planetoids?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: sure
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: but my ship can't land on it. lol.
[Newbie] Jimmie Smith: I'm trying to find the airplane service, but maping it won't help. I'm at Maraquda. Trying to find mining supplies.
[Newbie] Jimmie Smith: mapping, rather
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: There is a specific way to get there. It is a bit better to ask in character, but you have a few options on how to arrive.
[Newbie] Jimmie Smith: thank you.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: You are very welcome.
[Newbie] Jimmie Smith: how do I turn off the music in a sound pack?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: alt+m usually does it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Moran Midnight black designation: You can ask it on the Soundpacks chennel
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: What...the heck? So, I accidentally just died. I got my ship, and when I type heat-s on, I see the following message. "you are not of a high enough level to use this."
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Same thing for heat-s boost
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there any way to undo an in-ship teleporter, say if you typed the wrong room names when setting it up to begin with?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Gladr Gold scale: Serkan, just to let you know, PVP is an ooc concept, and the origins channel is an IC one.
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: hi, how do i install automove drive and jump drive on my custom ship? i've tried to install but it doesn't work
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: have you dropped the modules first?
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: yes i do
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: what does it say when you try to install them?
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: it says you can only install this to a starship, something like that
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Drop it
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: it's already on the floor
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Oops, missed the message, soemone already said it umm, make sure to drop it in your control room
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: some modules have to be installed on the outside of a starship. if it is not working from the inside try going outside of the ship, dropping the module, and then typing "Install <module> on <shipname>
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: ok, i'll try
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: thanks a lot, it works from outside
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: sure thing
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: hi, is it posible to rename my custom ship before it's completed?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Yes, it should be rename frame.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Or, rename followed by the name you called it
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: thanks a lot
[Newbie] Abdul Rahman: how to get mettle crups? I wanna repair my cargo hold
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: you need to go to planetoid or from debris if you have factory
[Newbie] Abdul Rahman: get mettle from trolley. I still have a lot
[Newbie] Abdul Rahman: I mean I wanna get it out from my resource trolley
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: fuse trolli for than follow how many metal you want
[Newbie] Abdul Rahman: ok
[Newbie] Austin Blake: How do I set the temperature of this shower? The scale is set in options and I'm doing t-controls and when I put in 140 it's saying invalid number.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: okay. so I just looked at the announcements, particularly the one about the resource market. In that announcement it says to go to salmira, but I can't seem to find that in the destinations thing on my info computer. am I breaking stuff?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: you now go to Salmira on Ship building Core facility 8,, type collect Salmira and you are given a floating crate.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: yes. that is correct.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: I was trying to find the place. but it appears that I might have done so.
[Newbie] Austin Blake: How do you emote on a channel again, is it emote surrounded by the star symbols?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Try type plan Ship building. Type map there and you will find it. It is the last result.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: ah, thanks.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: On IC chennels, yes.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: On ooc, use :emote for emotes, or .social for socials.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: so once I get my crate, where would be a good place to unload it? I just tried to do so in my cargo bay, but I geta message saying it has nothing to unload.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Better to do it in your factory storage.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: It is nice and quick.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: ah. and if you don't have a factory? guess you might just be out of luck then?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: You can try do it in some other plase, but I do not know what will be then.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: hmm...
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Or, hm, try to ask Icly. Maybe someone will be able to help you?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: I have access to a factory and it says I can't do that here. fail!
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: hi, sorry still on same matter, custom ship, how do i get higher heat shield level?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Install more batteries for it to get more charge.
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: aha, is there any limit on that?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Not that I know of.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: I think no
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: thanks again
[Newbie] Austin Blake: So, wait, how you gonna sell debris on the market, when the only way to get it in to storage is to refine it?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: From refinery, i think.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Perhaps from a ship or the refinery itself?
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: you sell it from your storage, as usual
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: just fill it on your refinery, but don't refine them if you wann sell them
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: wnt to, typo sory
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: so the help files for moon building talks about using a player's credits if their account fell in the negatives. Is there a way to infuse credits into the account for the moon if said moon is in debt?
[Newbie] Morgan Withers: How do you remove an ic link with somebody?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: it's unlink <comm device>
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: like, unlink radio
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: does one need to be in or out of a mining base to destruct it
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: in.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do i remove a door?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: @rmdoor I believe
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: and exit at the end
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So, question, so I know whether to suggest or not. When government shops run out of stock, is that stock repelenished by player factories?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: nope.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: replennewbie How is it replenished in that case?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: stocks refresh every 15 mins, type stock when in a shop to see how long till they refresh in that cycle.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I think I might suggest that it's replaced by player factories. You could get merchant ships to come to your factory, then take what you make to stores out of stock. It would mean that players had more control over economics, which in my opinion would be cool.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: also, allow for players who decide to contribute resources to also proffit from it.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I thought we were paid if we put resources on the market.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: only if someone purchases them.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: no you are paid when you  put up supplies
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: really? when was that changed?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: just now it is in the announcements
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: ah, thank you.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: How does one bomb an enemy subbase if it requires a landing pad name?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So I still might suggest that players can restock stores from their factories. Are any other players liking that idea, or not? If you don't like the idea, I won't suggest it.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: How does one bomb an enemy subbase if it requires a landing pad name?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: i don't think those are bombable. you need a planetary cannon to blow those up.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: All right. it normal to take more than one lob with a plc?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: i haven't done that mission in a long time. if it's been fixed, it shouldn't, but it used to.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: if it doesn't, you can scan the base with planetary scan, it'll show you the damage and percent of damage.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a way to choose whether you go into debt if trying to buy something in a store?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Olivia Bronze scale: I am not sure, sorry
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It's all right.
[Newbie] A small white mouse named Camille: in factory auctions, what are the commands i can use? list / menu don't seem to be working
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: How do I find Garry?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: you can ask on trade, "garry, where are you?"
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I am there, and I do not see him.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: he is on the galactic clean up ship
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: is it possible to transfer ownership of a horse?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: how do you keep further information in your bio hidden from the lookpu-person patch on your mapper?
[Newbie] Jessabelle Lawson: It's in your options
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: and I don't know how to transfer ownership of something
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: transfer-owner of thing to person
[Newbie] Shalous Out of Ilyina: how do you transfer a ship again?
[Newbie] Shalous Out of Ilyina: how do you check where you are a citizen of
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: What's the command to heal for mutis again?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: bheal player
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: thanks, Melody.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: also help files are your best friend
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: and no problem
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: what are claypits used for?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I happened to find one
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: I am tempted to say that it's just RP related, but I am not sure.
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: it's a place to get clay for moon base building
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: do we have a pawijawa smithy yet?
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: or what's their name
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: no
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: there won't be, I think
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: I'm goign to guess they can't infuse an armor either, or can players do it?
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: they can
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: I am not sure if pauagiwa get armour-making skill
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: ah, they can?
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: apparently so
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: uh, how does one repair armor again? It seems what i used to use is not working anymore.
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: Am I typoing I wonder.
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: what are you wearing
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: type ra.
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: Oh fml. that's awkward. Let's leve it at somehow I kept doing rs
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: what would the solar stuff be used for that I found in new moscow?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: Not sure what you are talking about. Sorry.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Likely an activity that's kinda high level.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I was exploring there and happened to find 2 rooms with solar stuff
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Type ahelp list to see all of them in order.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Upgrades, you mean. :)
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I think level said 1
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Not likely, since you can't even fly a ship in game till at least level 40.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I am going back to check
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: yes level 1
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: solar field generator
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Report that, and put it under misc. That doesn't sound right.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I bought it to check out
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: type x solar and tell us what you see.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I did and it said install solar on top of anything anything
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: something like that
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Huh. That might be for the farms. I don't know.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: oh I remember now it is
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: speaking of farms, is there any way to sell them if you're not using them?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: no I was thinking of the shield generator
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: if it was a farm thing it would have 150 level requirement
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: my suggestion, report it and attach your solar field generator that you bought to the report
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: would it not be an assist?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: it would not. It's not directly stopping your game play, is it? As such, it can be handled in a host's spare time. So it's a report. :)
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Ehpus, kindly report that, not assisting about it
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: okay
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: done with item attached
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: lovely.. Thank you.
[Newbie] Mike-tan Yellow scale: my harvesting gear is unalign properly. how can I align it properly? I shift down and down but the gear doesn't centred
[Newbie] Mike-tan Yellow scale: no. shift upr and down
[Newbie] Shalous Out of Ilyina: what is this about harvesting gear now
[Newbie] Galina Rose designation: Is there a way to change accents on your translator?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is it crush or smash to make chunks, (moon or otherwise) into bricks that are automatically loaded into the factories storage bay?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A male bat named Joyeux: it's mcrush.
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so the question again, is it that we are actually supposed to talk differently as if not having good speech? if so and I suddenly start please forget or ignore the way I used to talk?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: Hi there, on what planet can i find the Star Licencing?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: It is not on the research center
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: what are the advantages and disadvantages to having your moon base's power off?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: do tasks not get performed if moon base power is off?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Question. What are the new commands for resource market? I'm only asking because the help file shows that it hasn't been updated for months, unless it was done last night some time.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: Ok when you use your info computer, choose option 2 then choose option 3 in the second list.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: Hi there. where can you unload the crates from the market, I tried to unload in my storage room, my refinery and the mineral refinery and I keep getting the same message, the resource market crate has nothing you could unload here
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is it possible to have brief turned on when moving around, but also be able to see people in the rooms that we enter? Ratika too, etc?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: yes
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How is this done? Options?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: is done with the command brief
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: All it did was allow me to toggle things, but then when i looked at the room, I saw no description at all.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: And that's not what I want.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: 1 in the brief shows the descriptions and 2 shows the objects
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: when your done, hit 3 to lock it in
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Two is disabled, but when I move into the next room, I don't see objects.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: then hit it again
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: itl
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: it works the same for both
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Hey... I'm still having some trouble getting rid of a few things. The objects we get from the planitary equipment when they get caught in it, I've been told to bring it to a researcher, but the artifact places, research places, etc, don't seem to take them.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It says hide objects, though. If I inable it, I'm doing what I don't want in the first place. :(
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: go to science corp in 17
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thanks so much.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: take it to a dragon named sarah
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: ok, if you want to see the things in the room, do brief option 2 and then hit 3
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: you can turn them off or on and see how you like it to look
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It still does not do what I want.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: No matter what.
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: Ok you might need to report it or do an assist
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: I'm on Science Cor, and in the trash in space room which, I am guessing is the room, but the dump command is just not working with what's in my inventory... is there a trick to it?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: try it out side your truck i think
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Truck?
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: oh, your not talking about a trash truck are you
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: oh, your not talking about a trash truck are youplan sci
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: skip that last thing
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: hmm, oaccept
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: oops
[Newbie] Syuri Dark green scale: Ok, if the trash is on your ship you can take it to a planet and transfer it there
[Newbie] Ross Brown39557: Where do I go to pick up a salvage container?
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: How do you get a debris transport room on your factory so one can land and unload debris, I'm not seeing it as a room type to build?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Shimra Off-white designation: you construct it from your debris refinery, it requires 120 bricks i believe. you can move the exits around and unlink and link it later as you see fit.
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: thank you
[Newbie] David Brooks: Am I allowed to use other people's plants to transfer pictures when it comes to the junior colonisation master training activity? This person has allowed me access to the plant?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Are there ways to transfer debris, give it to people in canisters or something, by chance?
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: there is not
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: you can, however, transfer debris to player's factories
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: All right, thanks.
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: So are the escalators broke, because after installed, I don't see any way to use them, or even look at them.
[Newbie] A  lioness named Camille: how do you place a sleeping person on furniture?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Do mineral and gas upgrades and such stack in ships?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: help file says you can have anyone adopt you so what if it is a dragon or ryuchi how would that affect family name?
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: any race can addopt pauagiwa
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Is it possible to put tug lines on a ship to haul a cargo tank? Or do I have to buy a special ship?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: does the change mean we can just harvest volcanos til we want to stop or need to recharge?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: question about moon bases, if the base is powered off, does this mean citizens won't perform tasks, exports won't happen etc? what exactly happens or doesn't happen when a moon base is powered off?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: when a moon base is powered off, you are not using electricity, which saves you money, otherwise nothing else changes
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: okay, thanks.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: codewise, do fields generate on all sides of a sector, or only off to the east?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: all sides.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Awesome. Thanks.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: autoscan is showing chunks, how do I get them?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: neer mind, their a planet chunk
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how would one look for nests?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: ratika nests?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: good question
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: no for the wax drone thing
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: that's one thing I've never explored. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: how do you look upwards?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: look sky
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: How do i arange a meeting with the dragon queen
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: on navu, but where?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: I just don't want it to be complicated and take more time than necessary?
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: where can I get upgrade my ship to get 150k damage of defensive armour?
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: go to a battle station. I believe they can do it there, but I can be wrong
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: ah hmm, I can't find it in alpha 1
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: you can construct defence plates on your factory or use your info computer and find this upgrade there.
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: in the battle station?
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: no
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: this upgrade is selling on temreth now.
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: ah, I see
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: aha, got it. now where can I upgrade my ship's hull to 150k?
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: or how
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: hull reinforcement drones, constructed on factories.
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: thank you so much
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: why, I can use the remote to have my helper drone start my volcano harvester but when I try relocate command with the remote it tells the drone, you don't own that?
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: because your drone doesn't own it, you do
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: but the drone swipes her id card to start up the harvester
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: that means nothing. We're talking ownership here
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a bug with animal pens and going into the place to buy animals? Mine says it's not following me, and it is.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: are you matching?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I have two pens in here . Both mine. Hmm.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It says it can't seem to see me.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: try dropping it
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Ugh, sorry! It was in my inventory?
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: this sounds a bit ridiculous and I wonder, the month of being provided for before adopting and having it go through? Is this a real month time frame?
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: yaw
[Newbie] Ehpus Out of Komarova: so a whole more month of being stuck at below level 50
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do I move a tractor to another landing pad on Earth, so I can get an upgrade for it? I'm in New Cardiff.
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: take it to a runway and relocate
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: That's giving me a list of planets.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Relocate planetname
[Newbie] Emilee Hamilton: Choose the planet you need to go to
[Newbie] Retired JAG Barrister Michael Lawson: right, go to one, then return back to earth to a different runway
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I was on Earth, and needed to be on Earth, in a different area. I relocated to Tarania, then back.
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: is it possible to build a hut in an outside room of a house?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: yep
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a place to buy plant food in game?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: The help file for farming references plant food, as do the farm's stats, but I don't know what in this list of food choices would be for plant, if any.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: How does one put debris in a canister for auctioning? Is it just done in the refinery in factories or something?
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: it's from moonbase product
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: No, it's from the moon activity.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: moon base*
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Ah! Interesting. Thanks guys\
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: course 0 0 -6003, suba, amu dash, should return me to locals, right?
[Newbie] David Brooks: Not exzackly.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: what did I break? lol.
[Newbie] David Brooks: How far out are you?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I went course 0 0 6003 from paniax's sector.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I'm sorry, I can't remember which way the z axis goes, if negative numbers are at the top or the bottom.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Then that's what you want to go back to.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: oh, ok, I swore you had to go dash 6003 thheen amu down from their to get back....
[Newbie] David Brooks: negative is at the bottem
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: From wherever you are. Or, really, you could do something further in the sector. It does work. Just need to know where a sun is so you don't accidentally suba into its core.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: No. If you started out at 6003, that's where you need to go back to, because -6003 would be way, way at the bottom. In the end, it'll all get you to the same place, though.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: so course 0 0 6003, then once their, amu down...
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: you all are making a pigs ear of this
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: No.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: 0
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: What does that mean?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: type: course 0 0 -6500, and warp 10.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: job done
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: or quantum! weeeea!
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: if it gets really stuck, use manual to go down by one unit
[Newbie] Grake Donoven: is it posible to transfer more than 1 tril via bank?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Question about coords. If I type course 499, 0, 0, why when I stop moving are coords not matching? I tried it, and my coords when stopped are 498.2, 0.5, 0. Not 499, 0, 0. Is this normal?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, how do you disconnect a factory from a hauler? Help file does not say how to do this.
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: go to the control room of your factory and type anchor
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it is removed when you anchor the factory
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: the disconnection comes when you dock the hauler to the factory and anchor
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: when you go to your destination, just go to factory control room and type anchor.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: How do I dock it? When I type dock, says no dockable objects in range.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: the factory is always one unit behind your hauler, so make sure you are at the same cords
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you disconnect the factory from the ship?
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: use manual please
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, I'm confused now. The factory is attached to my hauler. In order to dock to it, it needs to be off of this ship, right?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: yes
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: scan your actory and make sure you are at the same coordinates as your factory
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Scan doesn't show my factory at all.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: When I bought it, it said that it had been attached to my ship, but scan isn't seeing it.
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: track it with your tracker 
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Are you using warp? If you use manual, it'll show.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it is attached. you will see it as you move
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, autopilot disabled.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: When I scan, I get "no starships in range," and "no spacestations or planets in range."
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: Stop and manual one direction. You may be able to see it then.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I'm assuming that planet scan will see it4
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it should also come up in your autoscan
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, for some reason it dropped my factory where I didn't want it. How do I move it again?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: by using manual or warp. Remember that when warping, you can't warp higher than 5 and it may take a minute for your factory to catch up
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: dock your hauler to it, go to the factory's control room and type unanchor
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I jumped to a station, and then set course away, but it dropped it there. I've found it, and now I am docked to it. It won't let me move while I am docked to it. How do I reattach it to my ship?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it is still attached to your ship. just undock
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: It must not have been attached to me, because it was over 400 units away. I had to go back and get it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: if you used warp higher than five or subatomic, you leave it behind
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Only warp 5
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, was travelling at warp 5, but again, it's not with me.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: give it a minute to catch up. it doesn't follow instantaneously
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: My understanding is that it is tethered to me. Is that incorrect?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So, just as a test, I went back to get the factory. It is currently at 0, 0, -50. I set ship to manual, then moved one unti, to see if it would move with me. Then checked again. Factory was still at 0, 0, -50. So, I moved two more units. Factory at same coords. It is not moving with me. What the heck?
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: you have to dock to it, unanchor it, then undock again
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Oh...I never anchored it in the first place.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Not sure how it got anchored. How did that happen?
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: when you got detached, it anchored itself 
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: It detached during the jump somehow, then. Weird.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you dock to another while on a planet? Is it possible?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: If you're trying to dock your own ships, type gdock
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Yep. Thanks.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Any time!
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, I released the anchor. But if I undock, it will just anchor itself again, right?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it shouldn't
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: no, it should be teathered to your ship again 
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, I've undocked. Now, as a test, I am going to manually move and see if it follows me.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, so I manually moved 5 units. I am at 5.2, -0.5, -50. Factory is still at 0, 0, -50. It's not moving with me.
[Newbie] Kinzi Shimmering blue scale: I think the only thing that works to move it is regular speed
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I was manually moving one coordinate at a time.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: the way you move a factory is to dock, anchor it, undock, fly to where you want to put it on speed or warp with speed at the very end. Then dock and anchor.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Yeah, except it's not moving with me so that I can anchor it. It's staying where it is.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: but you said you moved on manual. that's why it is not moving with you. It will not move with you if you move on manual.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: right. manual is used to navigate back to your factory because you will always be a unit away from it
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: It wasn't moving on autopilot either, Joyeux. It was staying where it was, even after I unanchored it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: Hmm. Well how about I meet you out of character and help you so that way we can trouble shoot.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Sure. I'm in my control room.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I wonder if it's not actually unanchoring it? After typing "unanchor," it says that the anchor is released, but when I type "unanchor," again, it says that it's been released, not that it was already unanchored.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, apparently warp cannot be used at all to move them, which I will suggest be changed. I'm using speed only, and it is following me.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Ok, how do I manually dock?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: strange, going to the three known places that should take me out of deep space back into local space doesn't work, 0 0 dash 6003, 0 0 6500 and 0 0 6003 all fail to work, and yes, I've attempted to move back down.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: so when you type course 0 0 -6003, and use warp, what happens when you get there
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: does it have to be warp? or can it be quantum?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: ehh, warp is more likely to work. if using quantum, extend it to say, course 0 0 -6500
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: if it specifically has to be warp, that's fine, but the help file doesn't specify. but let me see if I can do it with 0 0 -6500 and quantum at 42
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I just tried it, and I'm still in deep space with the four asteroid fields, specifically, xi gamma 3636
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Try autostop, then option 1.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: the commet help file says: move to the comet and automatically start moving after it. Match its speed exactly by using the warp command. I've moved to it, but how do I automatically start following it? am I missing something, I'm presuming ammu will do the strick but how do you set ammu to just go at say warp 6
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: never mind,
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: how do you clear smoke from a room?
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: is there a command to clear smoke? not seeing on here on the lp
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: dragons can type flap, which has a random chance
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: otherwise you needn an aircon
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: oh ok.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Oh, that isn't in the help file.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Hmm. Okay... so, when buying gas amount for scoop for star core equipment, is it supposed to stack at a single level? For example, I've been able to buy the level 1 upgrade a ton of times, and I'm not sure if it's actually doing anything to increase the scoop or if I'm blowing 300,000,000,000,000 credits each time on nothing.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: don't think so
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Ugh gods ... what a waste...
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Thanks...
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: welcome
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Sorry. Wasn't criticizing. Bugs happen. Just... kinda sucks. Thanks again.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: did the command for transporting ships from teh doking tubes from outside on factories change?
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: no
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: I might have run into a bug because no matter how I specify the ship name, it keeps saying Transport what?
[Newbie] Hugo Black scale: wat is the best way to destro the astroid the cordinates are 96.3, 72.2, 20.0." most i set 72 to 62 or do i somfing frong
[Newbie] Leneya Anderrson: Can you shoot it?
[Newbie] Leneya Anderrson: the asteroid?
[Newbie] Hugo Black scale: no
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: hi, why i'm unable to transport my ship to another dock from outside?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is the timer not behaving to reset the weather? Earth has been smacked by weather for a good few hours now.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: never mind!
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I don't understand this. I'm building a mineral refinery on my factory, and it says 60 metal panels required, even though there are more than that in my storage room.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: The help files say that a mineral refinery takes 99 panels. I have more than that in storage also.
[Newbie] Tobias Guttenburg: well, they said that they adjusted the requirements for them, but sadly they haven't updated the help file yet
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: How do I reply to a note from staff? No ticket, they just sent me a notice asking a question.
[Newbie] A Ball Of Slime Named Arglarg: how does one stop the unloading of a ship to a cargo tank if said tank is not unloading but says it is?
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: what do I do if my left leg and right leg are mangled?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: medical <radio>
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: I can't find a med center or anything.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: it'll take you to a hospital.
[Newbie] Maelitta Winter39672: Oh, thanks.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: np.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: can I use debris canisters to dump debris into my industrial plant?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Not directly. You need to unload them into your ship first, then transfer as normal I believe.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: If we vent phosgene, are we protected in our spacesuits?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: what result do you get if you try to shovel in an empty clay pit?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: If an escape pod is at a set of coordinates, and a ship is there, why is the ship not seeing me?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: maybe it doesn't have retrieve scan?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: it does, but it doesn't see the pod.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: are you in the same sector?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Should be. It was uncharted, just outside my factory.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: We should be, but I don't see a single pod.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: you tried tugging?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: While I'm asking questions, why are the universal coordinates so different from the other ones?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: both of you type UC. if the results are different, you're not in the same sector. UC are the coords of the sectors.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Would I need a tug ship for that, or will an asteroid hauler work?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: anything with a docking bay would work, it has to have tug lines and a docking bay. otherwise, you're not retrieving the pod.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Ugh. And looks like we're in separate sectors.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So, how the heck did I end up in such a different sector from where I was? Whoa.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Which I do not understand.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Wouldn't I be in the same sector where my ship went boom?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: i don't either. sometimes that happens, and it's wierd. tell me, what were the coords of your factory?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I went to the coords given, way east of his factory, but we're in completely different universal coords.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Wouldn't I be in the same sector where my ship went boom? Factory is at 400 400 200, in Ailing Heights.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: hmm, that's a wierd sector, that's one of the new ones. i'm doing some rp at the moment showing someone my ship, when i'm done, i'll experiment on that with you. it may need to be that we report this. neither your regular coords nor universal coords should change when your ship goes boom. how did it go boom anyway?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So I had heat shields up, and I was exiting a nebula field. Then, for some weird reason I re-entered the field (usually when I plot course away from the field(s) it doesn't re-enter them), and my ship went boom.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: And I a, mpt [
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: you probably reentered it because you were still in the coord range of the field. if you want to stop entering fields automatically, there's a feature called autostop. you can filter that setting so you never enter fields automatically again.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Huh what?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: And I am not pleased
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I hadn't thought of that autostop feature. Good point.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: And I am not pleased; I had nots of money invested in it.  Lol.  Home row works much better.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: you'll have to do that for each ship. also, fields are wierd, and blowing up in a field is probably the reason your coords got all wonky. what were your universal coords in the pod?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: -7, 27, 3.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: What, did the field throw me way far away or something? Did it hurl my pod through space?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: and the coords of the sector you were in?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Whereas I ended up at these: -102.27, 24.23, 3.00
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: when you save a syip on a drydock and it has drones inside, do the drones get saved, too?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: if the field did something, it wasn't ic. like i said, fields can do wierd things sometimes.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: I think yes
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: combat drones? yup. they're virtualized.
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: oh nice
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So I guess the question is, where the heck am I?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: UC again? chances are, in the smack middle of absolutely nowhere, but i'll go check on the sector you were in.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: -g, does that indicate sector 7?
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: -7
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: nope, that's 7 west of locals, west of 23 to be exact.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So how do you figure out what sector you're in in a pod?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: type UC.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I get -7, 27, 3.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So how are the sectors numbered? I assume there's some way to know.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: that's 3 sectors up and 7 west of 23. so, to get back to civilization, type destination, select one, and then type move.
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: is the transport command obsilete now? i can't transport this ship to my drydock to save it
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: And I'm way west of that, I guess. -102 and such.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper MI Lance Corporal Jitel Gold scale: Nate doing something with it, 2 days.
[Newbie] MI Private Yivana Midnight blue designation: oh ok
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: the sectors are numbered 1 through 32, and the middle universal coordinate is the one that matters. all local sectors are between 0 and 1 UC, and have a positive middle UC.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Oh how cool.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So, uc
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: the -102 UC sector, that's the sector she was in, that's one of th enewest sectors to be added, and it's icly quite far from normal local space. it's not numbered either.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So the middle number is 23, meaning I am in sector 23.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Yeah, that's what I was hoping, and that I hadn't been thrown out into the middle of nowhere. Quite cool, in any event, the additions.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: So what do the first and third numbers mean?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: you're not in it, but closest to it. think of the middle number as a reference. the other two have to be between 0 and positive 1 for you to be in that sector, so you're 7 west and 3 above it at present.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: first number is how many sectors east or west you are.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: third is how many sectors up or down you are. Like coordinates in locals but think of each number as the size of a sector.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: 3rd number is elevation, how far above or below you are.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Wow. How the heck did I get thrown all the way from ailing heights to omega? Wow.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Heck of a launch. Disney Land ain't got nothing on that.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: Well, Aling hights is far out of locals. It's basically in the middle of nowhere.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: that's definitely a bug, and the simple answer, you were in a field.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Are they aware of the bug, or does it need to be reported?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: report it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: honsetly, i don't know.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: Please report bugs even if you think the hosts know about it.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: That's about like the other day getting thrown into a sector called "simulation sector," for no apparent reason. I am not even sure what the heck simulation sector is.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: don't worry about it. as long as you report these things, then the hosts will know about it and consequently fix it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: not sure either, but there's a leave-simulation command, though i'm not sure what it's for, probably related, and probably something the hosts are testing.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Anybody know what that sector is?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: probably a hosty sector related to something that's not released yet, definitely the safest bet.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: It does not matter what it is and it is not wise to discuss bugs on public channels. Sorry about that.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Said I was over 2 billion units from galactic 0. That's a long, long, long way out.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: I feel like there's no harm in asking what something is. No need to get like that. He's a new player with a lot of questions.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: I didn't mean any offense. I was merely curious, as my ship ended up there twice. I didn't think curiosity was a big deal.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: It's certainly not.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: I am explaining to him our policy on discussing bugs. That is all. I am not being combative at all. Now if we can clear the channel, then we would all benifit.
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: How is it possible to know if someone is targeting you in an emote? If it's humans, it just says a human female or a human male.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: That's where intro comes in. Then you see the names.
[Newbie] Emilee Hamilton: cause they didn't introduce?
[Newbie] Diego Garibay131600: what file do I read for tt help
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: help teamtalk
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: You guys don't have a Discord by chance, do we?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: we do not
[Newbie] Zinjorg Green scale: discord is not accessible
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: I'm blind and I use it all the time.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: That's not entirely true. nevertheless, there isn't a CR discord
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: Is teamtalk accessible?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: yes
[Newbie] Jim Green designation: how do you retreive metal panels wit trolleys now that the clean command has been removed and scraps is for metal scraps?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: metal <trolley> for <number>
[Newbie] Jim Green designation: ah thanks.
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: how do you change your walking style again?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: styles
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: styles
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: For retrieval, you need tug lines, I think, but the only tug lines I see are called enemy tug lines.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: tug lines are a thing, just have a different shop is all. search upgrades for tug lines.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: how do you use harvesting probes? Help files show no commands or help related to them.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: The install command isn't working on subatomic crystals. Is something wrong with them? Are they obsolete?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: No, the install command is. Type refuel
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Okay, thanks.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: Because consistency is difficult or something.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: How do I use harvesting probes?
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: how do you get blood off items?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Hunter Trask: You need a washer and dryer
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: This is a watch so. lol
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: still need it
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: it'll still work
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: Okay.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Melody Lawson: remember to get laundry soap with it though.
[Newbie] Matt Hunter: how do i mount zinjorg
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: Sorry, you cannot ride dragons.
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: which is quite literally the message you get for ride (player) if they're a dragon.
[Newbie] Tobias Hamilton: That's only mutariansi though. It's ride <dragon.>
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: what?
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: no.
[Newbie] MI Corporal Vazbol: nono
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: What the heck? Metal panels were just boosted on the market, yet when I go to the market I don't see them, even though nobody bought them. It says nothing for sale.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: Is that a bug, or is there somewhere else they're located?
[Newbie] Adam Smith: is there a way to get back to the airlock from my docking bay. it says the envirenments don't match but there's no way to recycle them to the same from the docking bay.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: type cycle <shipname>
[Newbie] Adam Smith: it won't let me. i'm trying to get to the airlock of the same ship if that makes sense. sorry about this.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: ah, then go to the control room, type cycle from there.
[Newbie] Tannin Azure blue scale: As no one answered my question, I will assume it is a bug.
[Newbie] Adam Smith: unfortunately the envirenments don't match and the airlock is befoer the cr.
[Newbie] Adam Smith: before
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: ah, you're in a tugship?
[Newbie] Adam Smith: yep
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: how did your airlock get cycled?
[Newbie] Adam Smith: oh i did it to board another ship of mine that's floating
[Newbie] Adam Smith: and i couldn't get out as it isn't linked to a remote locker
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: okay, so you cycled your tugship from another ship if i get this right, then docked to your tugship?
[Newbie] Adam Smith: no i cycled the tugships airlock to hostile envirenment and then tried to exit and
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: a landing pad will do
[Newbie] Newbie Helper A ball of slime named Joyeux: Miscom
[Newbie] Xyra Hance: umm can we retrieve those spears that we throw and then lost?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Private Akasha Blake: how do I give nya a fox? she's supposed to have it.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Private Akasha Blake: how do you give a baby a toy?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Private Akasha Blake: how do I give a baby back its toy?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: If you type X <BABY>, the command should be in there. If I'm not mistaken it's play <toy> with baby.
[Newbie] Nathaniel Yellow designation: how do i get a list of ic socials
[Newbie] Xyra Hance: what skill i need to train to strip corpses?
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: just type @socials
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: just type @socials
[Newbie] MI staff Sergeant Tiosant Pale blue scale: sorry, misc
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: Is there a newbie mentor about by chance?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: all online mentors are viewable with @mentors
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: So I typed sling rocket, and now I don't see it anywhere. Am I missing something?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: nope. if you wnt to unsling it type unsling rocket..
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: I just thought it weird I couldn't see it at all. thanks. :)
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: if you look at yourself, it shows there maybe
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: okay, so I typed shedit, but I can't seem to find the ship in my ship docks. what did I break?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: and the ship I just tried to edit is now, floating, in space. what should I do now?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: if you just tried moving it from an access tube, that stuff may still be buggy, probably is. just get in another ship for now and s2s to it or tug it.
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: oh, okay.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: also report it
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: roger.
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: i am on novo
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: how do i move to other places
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: In what sense?
[Newbie] Caralee Watson: If you're referring to moving in ships, you may want to read shelp finding and moving to objects.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: if you want to move to a different planet you can do it in one of two ways, first you can find the teleportation chamber, if you have a mapper the command is map teleport. Once there you can type teleport <name of place you want to go. Alternatively I think you can just type teleport and be presented with a mind boggilngly long list of places to go. However not all places have teleportation chambers, so from the landing pad of any planet you can type "Taxi <destination> and you'll call a taxi to take you there. Taxies are not free, teleporting is
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: is ther eno way I can transport my ship to the ship docks of a factory from a hanger? it would seem that doing so from an access tube just causes the ship to go drifting out into space.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper JAG Attorney James Donivan: sadly no, but you can from inside the ship still i think. access tubes are still being worked on at present.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: that sounds like it might be a bug, I'd report it
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: I did report it. so we'll see what happens. the ship drifting off into space happened with the shedit thing. so that's fun.
[Newbie] A ball of slime named Zarali: do the animals repop in the forest of peace cause i cant find the lioness
[Newbie] Beatrice ElGaren: they do, once every half hour.
[Newbie] A large wolf named Zarali: why cant i understand someone when they have a mutaransi translator and they are talking
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: so a couple times I've tried to transfer some debris from a ship of mine to my factory from the hagers, and every time I try that it says I really shouldn't do that. is that normal?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: you need to do it from a debris transfer point. go outside your ship at the debris transfer point and type unload <shipname>
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: oh, I'm a dirp. that explains that then.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you load plasma into the ship's ammo whatever? I have a cannister, but is it full when you buy it?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Can someone please explain this to me? What are the regular ammunition boxes for on Mission? Ii've asked in character several times and no one is answering. Is it an OOC question?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: it is for weapons.
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: as in shooting weapons, like guns
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It has types in its name options, but these are for hand weapons, right?
[Newbie] a helpful Administrator: correct
[Newbie] Nathaniel Yellow designation: aassuming riuchi cannot use rocket launchers and the like
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Thanks.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Sorry to be annoying or whatever. I thought it was OOC, or people were missing the question altogether.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Also, how the crap are people buying resources so quickly? Are they command stacking?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: so I went into a field near my industrial plant, before I went in, I logged the coords as 2,461.0, 2,149.0, 449.0." I came out of the field, and thinking I'd be clever I set those coords as my course and warped back to it, but no industrial plant. What did I break?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: can you sell factories?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: When installing things like scanning modules, is it one for each control room on the ship, or one per ship?
[Newbie] Jason Hamilton: I think it's one per control room.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: scanning mods only go in the cr
[Newbie] Pheerblue Baby blue scale: one per ship
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Uh...
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: this asteroid hauler has two. Not likely I'd have two people in here, but still.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: It does have a secondary control room.
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: you could install both, but def not required
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Cool, thanks.
[Newbie] Alerie Red scale: is there a way to rename tamed pets?

[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: Beacon station, no I think.
[Newbie] Alerie Red scale: yes i think you can from your factory
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: chunks have to be done in a factory.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is their a comment to find blocked exits?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Susan Guttenburg: No, just look at the room.
[Newbie] Adam Smith: after i've been healed at a medical center i'm still limping. Is that supposed to happen?

[Newbie] Shiela Knight: How do I recharge my lamp?
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: I bought a classic car, but how do i enter it so i can get it out of the shop?
[Newbie] Shiela Knight: board car name
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: I did that, but it still says I'm in classic cars, not in the car I bought.
[Newbie] David Brooks: did you try opening the door?
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Yes.
[Newbie] David Brooks: Not to sure what is wrong. Have you tried enter car name?
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Yes.
[Newbie] David Brooks: Anyone else with ideas?
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: my friend died to a rabbit
[Newbie] Katrin Green designation: for some reason they hand you the car here. You're supposed to drop it. Not sure how that is RP but whatever
[Newbie] Lydia Paxton: report it as a bug?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: that is not a bug, but if you have other suggestions as how it can be handled, please suggest it using the suggest command.
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Once you have the car turned on, how do you move it? I'm typing w to go west, and I'm going nowhere.
[Newbie] Izik Sondro: type drive first
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: you need to type the direction then type acc
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Doesn't seem to be working.
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: I type w then ac, buyt my car doesn't move anywhere.
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: I typed w followed by ac and I got starting speed walk, followed by speed walk finished a second later, and my car still hasn't moved.
[Newbie] David Brooks: try typing commands here.
[Newbie] David Brooks: or command here.
[Newbie] Izik Sondro: x here also works
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: I'v done that as well.
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Think I got this, you type the direction, then a space then acc
[Newbie] A  lioness named Gulani: how to do you feed birdseed to an animal?
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: why cant my friend not be able to feed bird seed to her pet
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: you can only feed non donater itims to it
[Newbie] Cassie Shimmering blue scale: and the same thing is the carrits
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: How can I take my car on a train?lp
[Newbie] Eric Tamlyn: Is there any way I can take a vehicle on a jet?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: nope
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: move it to a runway and relocate it
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: anyone know how much space an industrial docking bay module gives you?
[Newbie] Beatrice ElGaren: 9000, I think. But you can only install it if your ship doesn't have a cargo bay.
[Newbie] Josh Broderick: ah
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: is that on top of the storage already available with industrial plants?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you recharge the plasma cannon?
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Is there a way to see how damaged an enemy ship when they're right up on you?
[Newbie] SDL private Calpurnia Malik: There isn't a way to shorten the planetary-cannon command, is there?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: now that I'm aware of.
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: not, even
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: p-c
[Newbie] Newbie Helper Drew Halithorn: actually I have no idea, sorry
[Newbie] SDL private Calpurnia Malik: I thought that existed also, but it doesn't seem to. Thanks anyway.
[Newbie] Evelyn Austin: how do i teleport from the academy?
[Newbie] Philip Williamson: head to the teleportation room and type home.
[Newbie] SDL private Calpurnia Malik: if you find the teleportation area, you will have to type home-planet. Thereafter, you use tele at those areas, though. Home-planet is how you graduate, though.
[Newbie] Evelyn Austin: says that's not a command
[Newbie] Evelyn Austin: registered with harmonia
[Newbie] Evelyn Austin: what is the home command?
[Newbie] Emilee Hamilton: it takes you to your home plannet
[Newbie] SDL private Calpurnia Malik: that's home-planet. It only works from the academy teleportation chamber, though.
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: How do you cool down the railgun after use? Something about water? But what are the commands?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: cooldown from the control room if you have water in ship's storage
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: oh. So I was right... no wonder it asked which bay to use. Do you need to do that even after one use? I didn't earlier. Should I do it now?
[Newbie] Newbie Helper SDL Midshipman Julia Sonders: you can wait until your heat gets real high. it takes a fare amount of water, so if I were you I'd wait for my heat signature to get up to 30 percent or so before using cooldown
[Newbie] Firaliana Peach scale: Ah, thanks.
