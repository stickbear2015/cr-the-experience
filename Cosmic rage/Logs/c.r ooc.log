[Ooc] HTPL Olivia Bronze scale: you can't assume we know what you are talking about or that a host has seen your report and is on this channel. that leads to confusion and like you just saw, assumption that you are asking an ic question.

[Ooc] Philip Williamson: I wanted the reset button on today, because I left my vape juice at home and had to borrow. sads.
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: I wanna know if vaping really helps migrains?
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: it does for me.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: no, but migrane tablets does..
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: but taht's probably because anxiety shit, CBD does, I"m told, I haven't tried that.
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: I can't take migrane meds,. because they make my throat close.
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: I'm taking topamax, which is ok, but man it makes me sleepy as heck.
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: that sucks!
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: anxiety is such a catch22 condition
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: it sucks!
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: yeah, it sure does.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: but you have anxiety because you're orried or stressed about something. You are then worried and stressed, because you have anxiety and all that comes along with. If you were never diagnosed with anxiety in the first place, and given the meds, would you not have eventually solved the problem that originally caused the anxiety and thus moved on?
[Ooc] Philip Williamson: I sadly have been and depression to go with it!
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: no, I don't think its quite that cut and dried.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: its probably not to be honest. I struggle to empathise with anxiety and depression suffers, because I physically can not get them myself. I brude for a day or 3, but after a point, my mind just has enough and moves on
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: take my anxiety for example, its not about one certain thing, but more about certain situations, IE going out in to hugely crowded places, I instantly shut down, and start pannicking
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: limited exposia?
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: or night, I'm terrifyed of certain things happening durning that time, so my mind causes me to agonize over those situations so much that I truly have physical sideafects.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: mmm. You shouldn;t watch those horror films. :D
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: I hate horror films,

[Ooc] Miah Thompson: I want to make sure I'm firmlyu understanding this before I make a suggestion or complain here. Are you all working on revamping trash collecting still?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: not... really no
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Okay, I'll probably feedback on this then, cause this looks like it might be something that needs to be readjusted. Unless trash collecting is meant to only be a supplementing activity to get you to volcano harvesting.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: que?
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Okay, had to do it as a suggestion, however, are there upgrades to the cube storage on those trucks?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: theamount of cubes is a hard limit, though the refined materials bay can be upgraded right up to 99 
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: the amount
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Okayh, yeah, I have the vehicle maxed at this point, then.
[Ooc] David Brooks: Did the change to trash require upgrades to be done to the trash trucks that are already owned?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: depends what you mean I guess
[Ooc] David Brooks: Well, I have a trash truck that I do not use any more. Had it over a year now. If I take it out to collect trash, will I need to upgrade it first?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: no
[Ooc] David Brooks: Ok, thanks for the answer.
[Ooc] Akasha Blake: there's a kittycat bothering me.

[Ooc] Miah Thompson: on what?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: trash collection, if your figures are correct
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Yeah, cross check me, I was assuming an upgraded vehicle, but, yeah. Even for newbies, that's gonna be low.
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: that's kinda lame
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: how crap is the payout?
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: What did I say, like 300000 for fully upgraded transfrring 20 cubes?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: yep
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: points or credits?
[Ooc] Host lara stardust: cred
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Crecdits, when you figure that it takes nearly a mill in credits to fill the vehicle full of liquid.
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: Christ, I can't type.,
[Ooc] Jason Hamilton: oy that is lame.
[Ooc] Miah Thompson: You end up refilling 3 times on a fully upgraded vehicle.
