[Room OOC] Jessabelle Lawson: Fail
[Room OOC] Jessabelle Lawson: Ignorem e, please...
[Room OOC] Zinjorg Green scale: yes. Basically, it's a metal frame with a reed arttached to it, and the reed has what's called a trigger so you can pluck it. You put it close to your teeth, not biting down, and pluck it. You move your lips, but you don't use your vocal chord, and you pluck the trigger
[Room OOC] Michael Lawson: well, that's a jaw harp alright
[Room OOC] Jessabelle Lawson: I've heard one. Not seen one.
[Room OOC] Zinjorg Green scale: they're quite small, like the size of, uh... half of a harmonica?
[Room OOC] Michael Lawson: look at that, look who mispeleld her own name
