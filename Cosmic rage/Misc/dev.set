#say {Welcome to the script help for the developer.};
#say {----------------};
#say {This straightforward script is designed to assist any developers in effortlessly manipulating the soundpack. Just a heads-up, this script doesn't impact gameplay whatsoever, so feel free to use it without any concerns.};
#say {If you prefer not to use this script, simply type devmod where you can enable/disable it as needed.};
#say {Commands available:};
#say {dev: Shows this help message.};
#say {DevR <path>: Reload the file from the specified path.};
#say {DevC: reconfigures the default editor.};
#say {DevO <path>: Open the selected file into chosen default editor.};
#say {DevU <path>: Unload the specified file.};
#say {DevL <path>: load the specified file.};
#say {spa: Open the Soundpack admin panel.};
#say {Note: To load, open, unload, or reload the file, you don't need to specify the file extension because the script already recognizes that the file you want to load or reload is in .set format.};
#say {So, what you need to type is the path of files you want to access, for example, devr misc/misc will reload the misc.set file in the misc folder.};
#say {----------------};
