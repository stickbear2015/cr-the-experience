[Soundpacks] A large wolf named Cerenity has just posted an announcement. Attention. I am writing this to make sure everyone is aware. There is a slightly new administration team for the VIPMud Experience. We have deleted all prior announcements. The 3 of us working the most on it are Frederick, Stormy, and me, along with others. Please check the info for the VIPMud Cosmic Rage Experience for more information. Credit for the lion's share of work, especially in the 2 prior years to this, does go, and will always go, to Snapp Blue Scale. We are keeping it alive and updated for your use. If you're not already part of the soundpack folder, please get in touch with either myself or Lara Stardust, and we can get you added. Thank you for your time, and I now return you to your normal Cosmic Raging!
