Control Alt Shift L: Load buffer list from the cosmic rage bufferlist.txt file.

Control Alt Shift S: Save the buffer list.


To switch between different buffers, use the Alt left and right arrows.

Use the alt up and down arrows to go forward and back between the messages in the selected buffer.

Alt 1 through 0: Read the last 10 additions to the currently active buffer.
