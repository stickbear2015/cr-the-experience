Thank you for downloading and installing Snapp Blue Scales Cosmic Rage Experience!

	System Requirements:
A computer capable of running the latest version of VIP Mud2.0  is a requirement, and in addition the soundpack requires  at least 1 gB of RAM and a bit of extra processing power to accommodate the playing of wave files.  You should also have a sound card capable of playing multiple audio streams simultaneously. In this day and age, It's highly unlikely any one would have any issues what so ever, but it's best just to make sure.
Included in the main soundpack directory is a file called sounds.ini. This file has been optimised to allow VIP to play as many sound files as possible, that is 100 at a time. Just copy sounds.ini into your main documents VIP directory, and answer yes to the replace file prompt.

	Installation:
To install this soundpack, first off, go and obtain it. Several methods are implemented for downloading the soundpack as well as all future updates. There is the standard .zip file that has been linked to, A BTSync folder has been created, and a shared dropbox folder has been created. If you'd like to be invited to the shared dropbox folder, just let Snapp blue scale know in game, and you will be invited as soon as possible. Secondly, go and make sure all the information is correct in the connection setup wizard within VIPMud. several questions have been asked about this, so answers will be provided.
	Under the Connect menu from within VIPMuds menu structure, find the Character Setup/Connect option. Hit enter on that and you'll be dropped into the connection wizard. A few edit boxes and options will present themselves. At least with the NVDA screen reader, the titles of these edit boxes are not spoken. The window text has been captured, and will be shown below. The following controls are available in this dialogue:
Character Name. Normally the name you give your character within the Mud.
Character Reference. A unique name that VipMud uses to identify your character.  It is usually the same as your character name, or if you use this character in other Muds, a name closely related.
Mud list. This list is compiled from other characters you have created.  If you have already entered a character for a Mud, the Mud name will appear here. Select the Mud and press Enter.  The Mud related information will automatically be filled in.  If there is no reference to the Mud, Tab past this list and enter the Mud information in the following three edit boxes.
Mud Name. The name the Mud calls itself. For example, "Cosmic Rage."
Host Name. The address to the mud. The available addresses to connect to Cosmic Rage are, "cosmicrage.earth," "cosmicrage.nathantech.net," or an IP address such as "87.106.252.196."
Port number. The port number is usually in the form of two to four digits. The port number  is supplied normally with the host name. The port for Cosmic Rage is, "7777."
Notes and Descriptions. A text box that is used to enter any information you need to remember regarding your character.
Password. The password of the character.  For security, this information is stored using encryption and can not be retrieved back from VipMud, and so you may want to keep another copy of your password elsewhere.  If enabled, this information is used to automatically log your character into the Mud.
Auto Login checkbox. Check this if you would like your character logged in automatically. It uses the alias "login" from within start.set to perform this function.  If this alias doesn't work for a certain Mud, you can easily make the appropriate changes as required. 
The next two options are not needed to run the soundpack, but they have been added for your convenience.
Keep Variable Values checkbox. When checked, VipMud will save your original and current variables files when you exit the character.  They are automatically loaded the next time you load the character.
Simple Script Control checkbox. When checked, VipMud will use the simple scripting file control method. See the "Using Script Files" section of the VIPMud manual for more details on this function.

	Moving on to the next step.
After you have obtained the soundpack and completed the necessary steps from within VIPMud, just select all from within the downloaded folder, then go and find your VIPMud directory. Assuming you haven't moved the directory, it will be in your documents directory. The directory name should look something like this. "C:\users\insertUsername\Documents\VIPMud." Paste the downloaded folders content, then either restart VIPMud, or use the #reload command.
If everything went according to plan, you should have a fully working pack! If something goes wrong, please go through and read the instilation instructions outlined above  and apply any changes necessary before getting ahold of snapp.

Updating your soundpack:
To update the soundpack using the Dropbox shared folder or BTSync, please do the following.
Please type @soundpacks and pick this one from the list. Take note of the latest change listed. After this, open up the folder that the soundpack is downloading to. Check the changelog and make sure you're seeing the last change that the moo showed.  Copy any files listed in the changelog, or you can just do a full copy of the folder. Please make sure to backup your characters set file if you don't want to lose any added alias's or triggers.
If you have downloaded the zip version of the pack, first extract the folder, then copy the content of the soundpack directory into your VIPMud directory.
 
Misc notes:
	You may type SPVersion or use the key alt-V to check what the last logged change the moo sees was made to the soundpack.
Please type SpCredits when the pack has loaded to view the list of credits.
The Dropbox shared folder and BTSync folder packs are updated at least once a day, while the pack that has the downloadable link is updated each Sunday.
To see the full list of changes, you can either open the changelog located in the help files directory or hit Alt-Shift-C when you have the pack loaded.
To see the last change that was made without opening the changelog, you can either type SpVersion, or go into the soundpacks menu, pick Snapps pack from the list, and view the pack info. You can also type version while on the log in screen of the mud.  The last change will always be listed here. Do note, please never use the key alt-V while on the logon screen. It breaks things.
If you get stuck and can't remember how to change a setting in the pack, you can type keys or use the key alt-shift-K to bring up the full list of supported keys.
If you have a suggestion you'd like to see added to the pack, this can be  done by using the alias "spsuggest."
If you have a bug that you need to report, this can be done by using the alias "spbug."  Please be as detailed as possible in your bug report. Try to include the error, the command you sent that gave you the error, and any other misc information.  Bugs that contain just an error, or two words, are likely to be deleted as Snapp can't fix most bugs simply based off of this.
If you have any questions or concerns, Please first take a look at the Help Files directory. More than likely your question will be answered in one of those documents. If not, feel free to get a hold of Snapp via an OTR link or over the soundpacks channel in the game. To enable the soundpacks channel, please type spon from within the mud. To disable the channel use the command spoff. To establish an OTR link, please type olink then hit enter. You will then be presented with an edit field. Just type snapp and hit enter. Snapp will accept your link request as soon as possible. If more help is needed with OLinks, please read the help file "Communicating out of character" from within the muds help system.
If by chance you find that a sound has gotten stuck, or is not acting as expected, you may use the key Control-F11 to stop all currently playing sounds.
If Snapp is not around to answer your questions, you are more than welcome to send him mail on the mud and he will get back with you as soon as possible.

Legal Stuff no one wants to hear, but It's necessary to write:
	Snapp is not a lawyer, does not know a lawyer, and is entirely unwilling to pay for the services of any legal advice regarding this project. That being said you should note that Snapp blue scale can not guarantee any level of functionality of this soundpack with your particular situation.  Snapp may not necessarily always be available to answer questions, help you install it, ETC.  If your computer suddenly decides that it can't handle it, catches fire, melts down or produces extreme amounts of smoke or radiation that result in your untimely demise, Snapp had nothing to do with it.  This soundpack has been tested under windows 7 and 10, as well as released for private beta use amongst friends. Snapp would not be releasing it as such if he believed that it would not be functional to a level of acceptableness. But do keep in mind that the pack is constantly being developed., so check back frequently for updates!

Happy mudding!
