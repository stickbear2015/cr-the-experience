	Thank you for taking the time to download and install Snapp Blue Scales Cosmic Rage Experience!

***Donating***.
	Want to help with the production of the sound pack without coding? Donations are always accepted, and will be used to help pay for migraine medications which I use to allow me to continue to code, the purchase of other sounds for the pack, and similar things. You can send paypal donations to kyle9475@gmail.com. If you wish to use apple pay cash instead, contact me directly. Thanks!

	System Requirements:

A computer capable of running the latest version of VIP Mud2.0  is a requirement, and in addition the soundpack requires  at least 1 gB of RAM and a bit of extra processing power to accommodate the playing of wave files.  You should also have a sound card capable of playing multiple audio streams simultaneously. In this day and age, It's highly unlikely any one would have any issues what so ever, but it's best just to make sure.
Included in the main soundpack directory is a file called sounds.ini. This file has been optimised to allow VIP to play as many sound files as possible, that is 100 at a time. Just copy sounds.ini into your main documents VIP directory, and answer yes to the replace file prompt.

2. You will need to go and make sure all the information is correct in the connection setup wizard within VIPMud. several questions have been asked about this, so answers will be provided.
	Under the Connect menu from within VIPMuds menu structure, find the Character Setup/Connect option. Hit enter on that and you'll be dropped into the connection wizard. A few edit boxes and options will present themselves. At least with the NVDA screen reader, the titles of these edit boxes are not spoken. The window text has been captured, and will be shown below. The following controls are available in this dialogue:
Things that need information will be surrounded by stars.
***Character Name***. Normally the name you give your character within the Mud. Not filling this out will cause the pack to throw errors. Note. This can not be "Unnamed" This may also not contain spaces.
***Character Reference***. A unique name that VipMud uses to identify your character.  It is usually the same as your character name, or if you use this character in other Muds, a name closely related. Not filling this out will cause the pack to throw errors. Note. This can not be "Unnamed" This may also not contain spaces.
Mud list. This list is compiled from other characters you have created.  If you have already entered a character for a Mud, the Mud name will appear here. Select the Mud and press Enter.  The Mud related information will automatically be filled in.  If there is no reference to the Mud, Tab past this list and enter the Mud information in the following three edit boxes.
***Mud Name***. The name the Mud calls itself. For the pack to work correctly, the mud name must be "Cosmic rage." Be sure to include the space between Cosmic and Rage or else the pack can not load correctly.
***Host Name***. The address to the mud. The available addresses to connect to Cosmic Rage are, "cosmicrage.earth," "cosmicrage.nathantech.net," or an IP address such as "87.106.252.196."
***Port number***. The port number is usually in the form of two to four digits. The port number  is supplied normally with the host name. The port for Cosmic Rage is, "7777."
Notes and Descriptions. A text box that is used to enter any information you need to remember regarding your character.
Password. The password of the character.  For security, this information is stored using encryption and can not be retrieved back from VipMud, and so you may want to keep another copy of your password elsewhere.  If enabled, this information is used to automatically log your character into the Mud.
Auto Login checkbox. Check this if you would like your character logged in automatically. It uses the alias "login" from within start.set to perform this function.  If this alias doesn't work for a certain Mud, you can easily make the appropriate changes as required. 
The next two options are not needed to run the soundpack, but they have been added for your convenience.
Keep Variable Values checkbox. When checked, VipMud will save your original and current variables files when you exit the character.  They are automatically loaded the next time you load the character.
Simple Script Control checkbox. When checked, VipMud will use the simple scripting file control method. See the "Using Script Files" section of the VIPMud manual for more details on this function.

	Moving on to the next step.
3. After you have obtained the soundpack and completed the necessary steps from within VIPMud, just select all from within the downloaded folder, then go and find your VIPMud directory. Assuming you haven't moved the directory, it will be in your documents directory. The directory name should look something like this. "C:\users\insertUsername\Documents\VIPMud." Paste the downloaded folders content, then either restart VIPMud, or use the #reload command.

Upon first run of the pack, you must do the following things.
You must copy settings.set that is located in the root directory of the downloaded soundpack. This file must go in Cosmic Rage/misc. Failing to copy this file will load the pack with very odd settings values, including file volume being all the way at 100 percent. Users who already have settings how they'd like, feel free to ignore this file unless you happen to lose all of your settings data.
Launch VIPMud. You will then need to set up your settings like buffers, volumes, toggles, ETC. Please see the help files for aliases and keys. You will then need to save your packs settings with control-s.
***notice***. Failing to follow the directions by not typing Control-S will throw endless errors if you try to load the pack once more. If this happens, just type SaveBuffers, and you'll be fine. It is not Snapps fault if you fail to do this. It's also a good idea to backup your buffer settings and general pack settings after you get them how you'd like.
If everything went according to plan, you should have a fully working pack! If something goes wrong, please go through and read the instilation instructions outlined above  and apply any changes necessary before getting ahold of snapp.

Updating your soundpack:

To update the soundpack using the Dropbox shared folder please do the following.
Please hit alt-V or type SpVersion. Take note of the latest change listed. After this, open up the folder that the soundpack is downloading to. Check the changelog and make sure you are seeing the last change that the moo showed.  Copy any files listed in the changelog, or you can just do a full copy of the folder. Please make sure to backup your characters set file if you don't want to lose any added alias's or triggers.
If you have downloaded the zip version of the pack, first extract the folder, then copy the content of the soundpack directory into your VIPMud directory.
 
A note about updates.

The Dropbox shared folder is updated at least once a day, while the pack that has the downloadable link is updated each Sunday unless a major change is made.

Misc notes:

A note about ambience.
In some cases, ambience fails to work for some players. This is do to the fact that they have brief mode enabled. If brief mode is enabled, ambience will not work correctly. To fix this, type brief, then disable hiding of discriptions.
To access the configuration manager, please hit "F-2."
If by chance you find that a sound has gotten stuck, or is not acting as expected, you may use the key Control-F11 to stop all currently playing sounds.
If you hear that gagging is in effect, please hit control-slash. This will force VIP to ungag your speech.
To view any of the help files related to this soundpack, you may either use the alias SpHelp, or use the key alt-shift-H.
To see the last change that was posted, without opening the changelog, you can either type SpVersion, or use the key Alt-V.
If you have a suggestion you'd like to see added to the pack, this can be  done by using the alias "SpSuggest." A note about suggestions. If snapp asks for text from you to make a trigger work, weather it be for gagging the text, adding a sound, etcetera, If after a month's time Snapp has no text to use to create the suggested trigger, the suggestion will be removed as it will be assumed it is no longer desired
If you have a bug that you need to report, this can be done by using the alias "SpBug."  Please be as detailed as possible in your bug report. Try to include the error, the command you sent that gave you the error, and any other misc information.  Bugs that contain just an error, or two words, are likely to be deleted as Snapp can't fix most bugs simply based off of this.

***Notice***.
If you're seeing errors and you have not updated your pack prior to October 10th, you must totally replace the intire Cosmic Rage directory, get rid of Cosmic Rage/misc/settings.set, then resave. This is do to how options are now configured. Failing to do this causes the pack to try to read settings entries that are not in use any longer.
If you have updated, and are not seeing errors when toggling options or changing volumes, you've nothing to worry about. This issue only seems to effect a small number of users.

If you have any questions or concerns, Please first take a look at the Help Files directory. More than likely your question will be answered in one of those documents. If not, feel free to get a hold of Snapp via an OTR link or over the soundpacks channel in the game. To enable the soundpacks channel, please type spon from within the mud. To disable the channel use the command spoff. To establish an OTR link, please type olink then hit enter. You will then be presented with an edit field. Just type snapp and hit enter. Snapp will accept your link request as soon as possible. If more help is needed with OLinks, please read the help file "Communicating out of character" from within the muds help system.
If Snapp is not around to answer your questions, you are more than welcome to send him mail on the mud and he will get back with you as soon as possible.

Legal Stuff no one wants to hear, but It's necessary to write:

	Snapp is not a lawyer, does not know a lawyer, and is entirely unwilling to pay for the services of any legal advice regarding this project. That being said you should note that Snapp blue scale can not guarantee any level of functionality of this soundpack with your particular situation.  Snapp may not necessarily always be available to answer questions, help you install it, ETC.  If your computer suddenly decides that it can't handle it, catches fire, melts down or produces extreme amounts of smoke or radiation that result in your untimely demise, Snapp had nothing to do with it.  This soundpack has been tested under windows 7 and 10, as well as released for private beta use amongst friends. Snapp would not be releasing it as such if he believed that it would not be functional to a level of acceptableness. But do keep in mind that the pack is constantly being developed., so check back frequently for updates! In smart and legal terms, Snapp or any other developer of this pack can not be held liable for any damages caused by the use of this pack or anything relating to this pack.

*A note from Nate, the head admin of Cosmic Rage.*

	Hello!
While it is not said often, please take a moment to think about this soundpack.
Over 500, nearly 600 changes at the time of writing this file, stemming back over a year of soundpack development.
The road is long, and definitely not smooth.
Snapp working his way through like this though has been absolutely astounding.
There may be things you dislike about the pack.
There may be things you love about the pack.
But when you use it, make sure and tip your hat to snapp in a "thank you", because he's worked dang hard for it.
Thanks
Nate.

	Happy mudding!
