Hello!
While it is not said often, please take a moment to think about this soundpack.
Over 500, nearly 600 changes at the time of writing this file, stemming back over a year of soundpack development.
The road is long, and definitely not smooth.
Snapp working his way through like this though has been absolutely astounding.
There may be things you dislike about the pack.
There may be things you love about the pack.
But when you use it, make sure and tip your hat to snapp in a "thank you", because he's worked dang hard for it.
Thanks
Nate.
